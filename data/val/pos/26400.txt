I thought it was an action before. As a result, I always thought that the plot was going on somewhere. Julie suddenly pulled out a gun and threw it. And it didn't. Have a good yearning for Venice, the plot is also good, the key is to focus on the two people I love. Depp has a low recognition without eyeliner. And put on weight.
