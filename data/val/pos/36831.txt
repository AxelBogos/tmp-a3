The early Chinese animation was also slightly influenced by Disney, but the later havoc in Heaven was completely self-created. The Wan brothers did not receive any education in animation before they did animation. they studied the practice of frame-by-frame animation instead of learning it from the United States, and the animation is very fluent. On this point alone, we should salute them!
