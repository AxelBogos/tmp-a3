It's pretty good. I wanted to play five stars, but I don't understand why Andrew's wife killed Celia because she thought they were having an affair because of the photos she saw inadvertently before. Celia and her short ambiguity at that time had a deeper misunderstanding and could barely talk about the past. I still don't get it.
