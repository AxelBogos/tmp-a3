Unexpectedly accidentally saw a masterpiece. I also want to find out why it was banned for eight years before it was released. If you don't talk about politics, there is no Q í ngs è but it is banned, which probably gives people unlimited imagination and poetic possibilities. The description of the relationship between men and women is very real, like a documentary and a movie. The discussion about the writers has really listened attentively, and can jump out of the problem itself to its objective acceptance and elimination, which is probably the effect of growth and the significance of accumulation. With regard to the relationship between men and women, the writers are right that they may have had a relationship, and the old love rekindles and continues to be linked. They may not have happened, but recalled it like that and regretted it forever. In fact, we should be lucky in any way, because we can still meet again, when the former and the latter have experienced it, will we be able to throw away the knot in our hearts at that time?
