The story begins in a game-like form. Pay attention to the details of the first half of the film, which will help to decrypt it. The ending is overturned and the trunk is buried so deep that you may not understand it if you are not careful. The little brother next door looked confused all the time. If it hadn't been for his girlfriend, I'd like to sort out the plot for him. The only regret is that the film wants to explore human nature, but it is not very in-depth. On the contrary, the protagonist is not set up well as a supporting role. At the end, he is moved by a number of supporting actors, and the eye of the crying needle is swollen again.
