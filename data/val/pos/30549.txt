I like the feeling of this movie very much, feel the clean and pure love, and appreciate the budding process of love. I believe that if you stop and walk into the cinema, you will be moved and conquered by this fresh and pure love. It has no big production of Harry Potter or the popularity of Transformers, but it is definitely worth seeing. .
