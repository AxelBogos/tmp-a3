Shiro's authentic original cartoons are very famous, and I haven't had a chance to read them yet. The world outlook of the works is magnificent, the mechanical settings are charming, and the human settings are not bad. Even if the story is vulgar, there is nothing we can do about it. After all, the original work is something from a long time ago. The 3D picture is a little rough now, but the slow motion of some action plays can still see the standard.
