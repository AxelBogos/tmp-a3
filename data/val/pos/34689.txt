In fact, it is a very turbulent background, the heroine supports the theatre, there is no sense of embarrassment of strangers, life goes on, rehearsing, settling a persecuted husband, maintaining a lover's heart. I like Catherine Deneuve very much, elegant, confident and beautiful. Besides, our lover with a big nose was quite handsome when he was young.
