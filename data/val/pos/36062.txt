On the eve of the American Civil War, Scarlett (Vivien Leigh), a daughter of Tara Manor on the Southern Farm, falls in love with another farmer's son Ashley (Lisley Howard) and is rejected. In retaliation, she married a man she didn't love, Charles, the younger brother of Ashley's wife Melan (Olivia de Haveland).
During the war, Scarlett became a widow, lost her mother and carried the burden of life. She was no longer the original daughter. After the war, she became a wife twice and married Rhett (Clark Gable), a speculator who loved her for many years.
However, despite the hardships of life, Scarlett's feelings for Ashley have not changed. The death of Ashley's wife, Mei Lan, gave Scarlett a chance to love her husband on the one hand.
