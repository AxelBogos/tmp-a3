I always thought this was the most beautiful horror movie ever made. The acting skills of Wen Genying and Lin Xiujing are amazing, and the hysteria of her stepmother Lian Jingya also makes people feel frightened. Rich and luxurious colors and melancholy violins are the most impressive ~ YouTube has a MV who uses Heather Nova's Island to do background music, the essence of the movie condensed version, the lyrics are so felt that I burst into tears!
