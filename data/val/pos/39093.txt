Well, I really like this style. Like Captain Jack and Depp don't explain. Rather than saying that it is acting, I would rather say that it is a kind of personal charm. Depp's personal charm and Captain Jack's character blend together, I am completely fascinated ~ ~ Orlando all kinds of handsome do not explain. Knightley has always been the image of Pride and Prejudice in my eyes, and she has all kinds of favorites. Anyway, I like this movie. It's just a little hasty at the end.
