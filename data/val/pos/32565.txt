In fact, after reading it, I saw a picture of Bergman and his mother in the bright light, with his chin in his hand and his eyes full of tenderness and infinite attachment, looking at his mother sitting next to me in the dark area. I suddenly had a sore nose and tears were about to come out of Bergman, who mercilessly squeezed art from his own experience, like a cries and whispers of despair. Sometimes I wonder how painful he should be, how painful he must be, his struggle, pain and questioning the impossibility of communication between people, natural powerlessness and lack of indifference and estrangement, even death can never cut off hypocrisy and hypocrisy instead of love to attend the possible warmth of life. Bergman's work is as heavy and desperate as he is. I really hope that in your next life, you can be simply happy and deeply loved by others, even if you are just an ordinary person from childhood to death.
