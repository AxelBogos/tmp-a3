Focusing on the war in small countries, the whole film is filled with the sadness of small potatoes and helplessness in the face of the invasion of big countries. From the simple equipment, the wide disparity of troops to the popular welcome to the German army is exquisitely reflected. The director devoted a lot of space to showing the Danish army running around on bicycles, creating a sense of humor that contrasts sharply with the hostility of modernization.
