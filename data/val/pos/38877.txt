I think it's great. I don't need to complain about why Russians don't speak Russian and their eldest cousins are not fit for ballet. I think I've made all the points I want to express clearly, and there's nothing unreasonable on the storyline. I think it's all good. Five stars is for the naked cousin. It's much better than "Mother." it's not a bad movie. When I was a child, I didn't think it was boring. What I like most is the end of the film.
