When I saw it on TV a few days ago, it was amazing that I hadn't seen this old movie. I think this play just saw the acting skills of Chow Yun-fat. I didn't want to stay up late to watch it before. I didn't want to stay up late to watch it, but it was too long to watch it. Later, when I went to watch it online, I found that the TV had deleted a lot of shots. So I went to see Shanghai, which has such a good reputation. It's also magical.
