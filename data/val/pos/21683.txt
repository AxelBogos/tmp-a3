When British people make literary films, they will have a sense of accent. Caravaggio is more like a sad Shakespeare character than the passionate Italian painter. At this point, the film is not about the real Caravaggio. I think the shooting technique of this film is very cool. Uncle SB in the fresh meat period and Aunt Swinton in the fairy period are something to watch, and the film itself has different opinions.
