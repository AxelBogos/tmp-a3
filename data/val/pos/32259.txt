I really like it. See the transformation of the flower field, Zhu Mei's natural and moving beauty, as well as the brave temperament and reunion. I watched the whole play with a smile, and of course there were a lot of things that made people ponder. The flaw is the part of narration and recollection, and the insertion is not very good. In addition, the director creatively said that the relationship between man and woman No. 2 is placed at the end of the film, which can make good use of the surplus value.
