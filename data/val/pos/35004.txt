After reading it, I felt that the blood was rushing, like drawing a circle of the whole story from a starting point to a perfect end. Then I ate a strawberry-flavored ice cream to calm myself down and return to reality. There are many things that can be pondered in the film, but there are no words to say, because the director has all spread out, and it is nothing more than repeating what he has said. I thought of [simple and rude] lyrics. That's probably how it comes to conclusion.
