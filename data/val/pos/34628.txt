He finally became a real man. There is a lot to say about the film, the director did not express his inner thoughts bluntly, but he expressed a lot. For example, gay cowardice, such as what is a real man, and what is love, is not only the love between S and M, but also the wife's love for M, such as respect. The novel theme is expressed in an implicit but tense way. All the tears are at the end.
