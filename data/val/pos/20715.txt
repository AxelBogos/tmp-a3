Free-growing horses, because of curiosity into the trap of mankind, have since become slaves of mankind. After striving courageously, he finally escaped from the clutches of mankind and had a sincere human friendship.

This is a history of human harm to nature, although horses escape, but can not stop human harm to the earth.
