Having seen this film is not only the visual feeling, but also the inner shock and the baptism of the soul, the two protagonists, one is a good student in college, the other is an eccentric blind uncle, two strangers, because a minute of work is connected, from the beginning do not understand each other to the final change of each other, the whole process is really worth thinking about. The best part of the whole film is that the last speech is also my favorite part.
