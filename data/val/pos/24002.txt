The long comedy brings a stronger sense of tragedy at the end. The classic part where four people walk. I thought the old lady would take the initiative to join us. It turns out that everyone is afraid of death, so his mother will hide and recite the sutra. I have no problem with the ending. A person like the protagonist who has a sense of morality and thus suffers from it is entangled with it. Maybe suicide is a good end-result.
