Douban's score has never been accurate, so true, I should give him a full mark for a film that shows how many examples in life are fresh and unaffected. I have a real feeling that women's unease is inborn, not from birth, not from perverts, but with a trace of fantasy about true love. It's not difficult to understand that you don't think it's because you don't walk barefoot in the middle of the road in the middle of the night. Crazy love is very common and comes naturally, and you are lucky to experience it.
