There is a special smell of pain in the air. Chinese martial arts can go up and down without hindrance, which means that there is a sense of national education, and there is a lack of special effects of divine help, but it is great! In particular, I think it's great to see that he Tao and "never fall" are right when they fight against each other. The flaw in the beauty is that the eloquence is too strong, and the crab boxing of Sanzang Jun actually makes me laugh.
