There are too many things in such an epic film. War, carnival, banter, scheming, sex and betrayal, the difficulties of the people, the exile and destruction of the people, the era of change and underground utopia, fatalistic fate, magic, divine endings. This film is amazing. Kusturica is really amazing. (it always feels that there are a lot of things about Jiang Wen in the movies, and the picture of geese and geese walking is simply "letting bullets fly". )
