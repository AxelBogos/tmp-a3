This is one of the greatest works of that kind, and it will never be a movie again. Thanks to Tolstoy and Big Brother of the Soviet Union for bringing us a sense of Russia at that time. All I can think of is the sentence in the film, "he was filled with joy to find that life is ever-changing; life is great and incredible; life is endless."
