The Golden Rooster Award for best cartoon at 05:08, after I have seen so many ratings, I have become accustomed to it, and the vice president's eight Oscars at 06:08 are not as high as the White House, which is full of personal heroism. Some people are not the tragedy of the times, but the stupidity of being a cold bystander.
