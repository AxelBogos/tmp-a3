The composition is excellent, the inner anxiety of the characters affects the mood of the audience, depression and despair are filled with the postwar Japanese spiritual world, just like a series of tricks to cover up the truth in the ruins of the arms factory. The ending is tragic, and Akira Kurosawa's ending this time is what I expected, with a leopard-tail-like cleanliness and a sense of strength. A simple story in Akira Kurosawa's lens is a full drama full of danger and tension.
