Easy to see bloody revenge, difficult to see self-redemption; easy to see class contradictions, difficult to see survival anxiety; easy to see excitement-seeking madness, difficult to see numb pain; easy to see despair, difficult to see detachment; easy to see masturbation, difficult to see self-destruction; easy to see causal simplicity, difficult to see polysemous universality; easy to see image discomfort, difficult to see self-discomfort. This is indeed a movie that picks an audience. It is easier for those who are not chosen to live, and it is more difficult for those who are not chosen to live.
