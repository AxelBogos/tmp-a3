Not bad, although the originality of the whole script is still very low, and the shadow of "Toy Story", "insect Secret Service" and "Forest Warrior" can be seen everywhere, but the addition of the bald strong father role is still quite tearful, and finally has a role for adults to see. The production level has also gone up, and the effect of the micro world is quite surprising. But don't expect any hope for bears in this series.
