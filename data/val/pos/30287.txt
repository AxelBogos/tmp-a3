A star for Hiddleston. The highlights focus on the last 1/3. It is said that Henry IV, but the performance of Henry IV is too little, it can be said to be a prequel to Henry V. It doesn't make much sense for a fat old man to play too much. The whole favorite part of Henry IV: Prince monologue, father-son confrontation, wearing a crown, Heng Wu ascended the throne.
