I remember that it was in the Anglo-American literature class that I downloaded this movie of the same name, which was idle on the computer for a long time. I was surprised to see it. This is the best female film I have ever seen. Four pairs of mother-daughter parallel N mother-daughter stories have profound meaning. I will watch this movie again in the future.
