The Chinese movies of that time were really full of sincerity, and it was very lucky to be able to watch the movies with Director Wu's story. Zhang Yimou is well-deserved as the actor of China's first international A-level film festival. Behind his simple and natural performance is months of dormant experience and study. This pure effort is almost beyond the reach of today's actors.
