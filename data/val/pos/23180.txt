I haven't read the original work, and I feel better than the level of Sin City 2, but it's hard to see the glory of yesterday. The PG-13 level is as bloody as the R level, and to be honest, this shooting scene is not much different from R, so it's better to be bolder in storytelling. Unfortunately, the story itself is an old-fashioned prequel. Although it is a cyberpunk story in the skin of a cartoon, it is so far, even more like a movie like a superhero, but more brutal and darker. Except that the ending is too bad, it is not much different from other special effects movies. The special effects are really wonderful, and it takes a lot of effort to see them. The audio-visual effect is comparable to that of the New Tomb Raider, and it can be regarded as some bright spots.
