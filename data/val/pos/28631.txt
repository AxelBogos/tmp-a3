Yamamoto 56 is known as the "flower of the navy", and the flower is feminine and delicate, and the flower means fragility, but its beauty comes from this fragility. The background of the unbeatable "big" Japanese empire is still the beauty and brittleness of small flowers. The battle of Chrysanthemum, the special attack of kamikaze, and the charge of Banzai all took place after the withering of Yamamoto 56.
