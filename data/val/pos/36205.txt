Uppercase COOL! It's a very obvious feminist theme, but as a woman, I really want to say, it's too much fun! At last, the two leapt hand in hand and wanted to cry a little bit. The rise of women seems to be a great challenge to the patriarchal society. Once again, I feel extremely honored and proud to be a woman! Ladies,Just be yourself!
