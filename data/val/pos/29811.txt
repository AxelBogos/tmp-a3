6.7 I am still a little unhappy. I don't know whether it is nostalgia or something. I always think that the movies that brought us joy in the past should not be so low, but now they are also very good to watch, such as brisk action, accumulation of action details, and a sense of painting. I think this is a good action movie with many shortcomings. Don't play through funny martial arts movies. The lines are too modern, the rhythm is a little bad, and the special ending is special. But maybe the director did it on purpose.
