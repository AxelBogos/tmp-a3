I love it, the first five stars of passion this year! Like soundtrack, like stories, although the ending is not very sharp. This story seems to be tailor-made for Redford and Spacek, dusk love is too romantic, such a story as a farewell work is not appropriate, Forrest can still see the shadow of Sundance Kid, Redford is so charming!
