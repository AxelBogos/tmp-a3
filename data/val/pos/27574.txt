The film discusses the moral judgment of human nature. Is it murder or mercy to end other people's lives before they suffer? In the first part, the atmosphere of suspense is rendered well. In other words, the actor who played the murderer is quite handsome! Generally speaking, compared with other films of the same period, I think it is quite good!
