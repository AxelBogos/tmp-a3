(7x10) because I couldn't climb the wall without a Netflix account, I had to watch the official main plot version (90 minutes, thanks to DEFLATE suppression). The editing idea of the official version is still clearer than the live screenshot version of netizens, but it is a pity that less female doctors end up using Chunli to sweep the legs of the man (the daily live screenshot prints are of poor quality and the sound is out of sync). This kind of interactive works like AVG and GAL-GAME have actually existed before. When I was a child, I saw the interactive cartoon of Crayon Xiaoxin, and the readers chose the plot route by themselves. Although this kind of work is interesting, it may be difficult to become mainstream. This film takes five hours of material in 90 minutes, and you can actually play the ending in less than an hour (the rest of the time will allow you to experience the plot of other branches. Until the full 90 minutes). And audiences prefer to listen to stories rather than edit them themselves. If you think of this film as an AVG, then it is not very enjoyable, at least compared with excellent AVG such as Destiny Stone Gate.
