Change the five stars again. With enough restraint, another director may present a Korean-style tearful drama, but Li Cangdong uses his literary expression to present the story in front of you, and the true meaning of the story needs to be interpreted by the audience. You can interpret it as a discussion of religious consciousness, or you can understand it as the opposition between forgiveness and anger, either way, will eventually be attributed to reconciliation. It can be classified as a psychological thriller.
