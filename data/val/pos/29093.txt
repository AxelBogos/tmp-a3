Hollywood's wives, daughters and sons have all come out to direct the play. The emotional play is delicate, euphemistic and moving. It's just that Rebecca Miller's film is always so short of excellence. Winona Ryder, who was as beautiful as a daffodil, is now crippled, neurotic and wearing a lot of makeup, but Aunt Moore is getting more elegant as she gets older. And the male god Keanu, as always, is heroic, with a reverse growth posture, contemptuous of time with long legs and beauty.
