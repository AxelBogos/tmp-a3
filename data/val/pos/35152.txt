The score is only 5.5. I really do not know what kind of psychologically dark Chinese, with emotional subjective score, Kung Fu Wing Chun this play is really good, at least let me see from the beginning to enjoy the end, Bai Jing's performance is remarkable, pat Bai Jing is really talented. Some Chinese who are dark and creepy in mind, the low marks you give are not only tasteless but also shameless. You are fit to watch the temptation to go home.
