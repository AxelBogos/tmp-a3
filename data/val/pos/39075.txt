Political irony. The works represented by Yugoslav comedies and Czech clay animation are full of unexpected and strange imagination. In the underground world, there is no Yugoslavia, she is just a dream, the entrance of the dream is Germany, the exit is Italy, the revolutionaries in the dream inexplicably experienced all the love, betrayal, joy and sadness, and really can not end in the end. The scene of Ivan holding the orangutan and holding the pony while crying spoiled me.
