The first ancestor of Li Li, laughed so much that she couldn't take care of herself. Afraid wrapped in part by a female passenger, and everyone went up to make her calm down to know that everyone would line up and laugh at shit. A thrilling but hilarious crash landing, all the movies in the 1980s had the special effect of Gaga, baa can be directly on the five stars at 5, coupled with the white god to help push all the laughter to the highest point, perfect, a classic.
