I did not expect that Hong Kong would also produce such a dull film of literature and art. It is not a new trick for the leading actors and actresses to take care of children together, and terminal illness is not a drama, but perhaps it is the implication that is becoming more and more rare in today's big movies. And the romantic ending deliberately made to hide the sadness makes people cry. The theme song says, "I'm more afraid of being alone in the end after love." what could be more desperate than hoping that I had come? But it doesn't matter.
