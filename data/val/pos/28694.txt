At first, I was in the mood of "even if I want to scold, I have to scold with reason after watching it." after reading it, I want to say that this imagination is extremely powerful, and the lines are not awkward. China's ability to shoot such science fiction works is really worth blowing up. Whether it is a change of the United States, a change of devil, a change of hair or even a stick, the film will not feel inconsistent, and it has to blow up the imagination of igniting Jupiter. How come there are still people hacking when the Chinese film it out? It's boring to be black for the sake of black. Although it is so sentimental and dense that it seems to be free, but this film is really awesome!
