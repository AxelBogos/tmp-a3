American animation and Japanese animation rarely have the same meaning. District 11 likes to celebrate the power of friendship and the greatness of faith, while Meade likes to save the earth and human beings by super hero. This film is a rare animation that describes human nature. Compared with adults' fear of the hidden meaning behind giants, children are just beginning to feel fear of strangers, so adults will never understand the world of children. Because there is no childlike innocence.
