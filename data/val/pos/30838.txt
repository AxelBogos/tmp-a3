What I specially went to see today was so shocking that we could not participate in the era experienced by the revolutionary martyrs, only to learn a thing or two from the movies. How many revolutionaries fought hard and made fearless dedication in exchange for today's peace and prosperity. It's a pity that there are too few films.
