"I believe her growth began after what happened on the beach that day." Girls, girls, women, women, each stage has its own label and characteristics. Love is the fireworks foam of life, life is the stubborn stone that breaks the love mirror, and what women want to pursue in marriage. The pace is slow but not procrastinating, and the narrative is great.
Well, my own film aesthetics still needs to be improved.
