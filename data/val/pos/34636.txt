The soundtrack is so good, especially the ending, which shows Ren Dahua's deep emotion. Liang Jiahui's role is a character tragedy, in fact, the outcome has long been doomed. The inner system of the underworld has been developed and perfected for hundreds of years, and more attention has been paid to the rules and precepts within the gangs. Johnnie to has constructed the tragic fate of the underworld from the outside to the inside. The older generation adheres to the rules and establishes the tradition, and the gangs with complex interests are doomed to greater disputes, the fate of the individual is elusive (represented by Louis Koo), and the gang godfather-style A Le is experiencing power and inner anxiety. Not only for the gang itself, but also related to the survival of personal honor or disgrace, the gradual blackening of the internal attribute is a doomed identity tragedy. Johnnie to's black image is still convincing, but fortunately he didn't watch the Harmony version (don't look at the Harmony Edition).
