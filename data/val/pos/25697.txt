The pictures and characters are so beautiful! Fortunately, I didn't miss it ("Shell" and "Star Cowboy" also gave me the same feeling), the cartoon needs to be mended. Perhaps the earliest source of the "jet / rocket"-boosted battle hammer / tomahawk that has been seen in some films in recent years is the original work.
