I once liked this film very much, and later I strongly recommended it to Cheng Cheng. unfortunately, he said that you like romance, and that I should be the kind of girl who has very romantic expectations for love. no, no, no. GOD, is that true? Maybe the scenery in this movie is so beautiful. Xiao Yin even said that every picture can be used as a weekly noodle. It's really good.
