Such a great movie Douban 6.6, I don't know what to say.
From the point of view of the film itself, this is the best interpretation of the nature of Godzilla. When Godzilla first released a purple laser and spewed the flames that enveloped the whole city, no one would doubt that he was the destroyer of mankind. That fear permeated from the inside out is the truest portrayal of human beings in the face of such existence as Godzilla.
