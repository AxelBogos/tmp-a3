At the beginning of the film, I can feel sorry for the role of Aaron Kwok. When people are unlucky, they are really memorized. After the suspense layer by layer opened, the big boss began to mess around, but also people have been worried about how to get rid of him. Although a lot of suspense can be guessed, the overall plot still gives people a sense of breaking the situation. Some of the details are quite real, after all, not all police officers can jump from one building to another.
