Quite a surprise. The combination of the real scene and the virtual reality of the animation can be quite real, and the setting without dialogue lowers the threshold of acceptance, but it is amazing because of the wonderful lens language and cute modeling design. It is also a French / Belgian film. "rumba", which was seen in the archives for the first time that year, is quite similar to the film. In addition to the "artist" who has won the golden man, the silent film retro is really an artifact to break down the language barrier.
