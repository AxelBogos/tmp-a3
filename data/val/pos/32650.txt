There are a lot of cute things inside, dazzling, but the ultimate cute or father and daughter become little bats. Big ups and downs of the characters, quietly off the line of the giant hairy monster. The regular action mode of walking animation makes the elf hotel series different. I had a great time, and the setting was great, but it was the same old story as the first one. But the flaws outweigh the flaws! I like it
