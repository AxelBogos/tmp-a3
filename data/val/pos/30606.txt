At the beginning of the war, I felt that it was very playful, but the more I saw it, the more sad it became. Yang Youning is so handsome. The eyebrow is clear, the face is firm, the figure is tall and erect, the sense of age. It's like the black and white photos of my father in the fifties and sixties. Thick lips, no wonder they always look familiar, so much alike.
