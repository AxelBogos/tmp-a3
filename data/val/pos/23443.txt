This film is adapted by legendary American director Kubrick based on the novel "Red Alert" and aims to satirize the cold war situation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. It's ironic, and it may underestimate Kubrick's level. Because this film contains not only satire, but also male hints, Nazi thinking, cold war peace, surrealism and other themes and artistic techniques, it can be said to be a model of diversified theme films. Important figures such as American presidents, Soviet ambassadors and British generals are either bald men with no opinions, spies photographed secretly, or minions of Americans under the design of the director. The most admirable thing about this film is that Peter Cyrus, who plays Dr. Qiai, plays three roles, while playing the role of British Air Force adjutant, President of the United States, and Dr. Qiai, which is not only a delicate design of the director, but also a subtle metaphor. Therefore, "Doctor Strange Love" can be called the film that best reflects the dark comedy and has enlightening meaning.
