3.5. Very commercial and safe adaptation, without going deep into the original content, everything is superficial. Even though the narrative is scattered, broken, current accounts, with a group of actors and sensitive background blueprint, the film still maintains a high level of entertainment, a variety of black countries have been tried and tested.
