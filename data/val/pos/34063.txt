-I don't know whether Emma's script is better, or Ang Lee is more sympathetic than Joe, which is much better than another Austen book, Pride and Prejudice. The actors who like movies very much, pronunciation dialogue, landscape music, and even the horse pulling the rickshaw are all handsome. Four stars have spent time at Hogwarts, and Alan is a patient lover. The Kate goddess is 19 years old, and Uncle Hugh reproduces the charm of "Universal Housekeeping". There is a lot of contrast and care in the movie, and the more the product is, the more interesting it is.
