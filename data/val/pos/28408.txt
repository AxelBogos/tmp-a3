Living in Uganda, I come into contact with this group of people every day. I don't go to the slums very often, but I often pass by. Katwe is on the airport road, and the stadium where the coach plays football to earn money is by the side of the airport. The film is a good way to restore the daily life of the slums in Uganda, and it is very good to inspire according to the true story. The key is that the English with a familiar Ugandan accent, coupled with being able to understand a lot of local dialect, feels so friendly. High praise!
