It is really a silly and hilarious anti-hero film. What kind of hero is this Green Hornet? the idiot is shameless, wretched and incompetent, and he is still a dead fat man, all to set off the wisdom and martial arts of Zhou Dong. Zhou Dong also used all his 18 classes of martial arts, piano, singing, nunchakus, nunchakus, and acting cute, giving people the impression that he was really a pity to accompany the old deformed Camelon Diaz.
