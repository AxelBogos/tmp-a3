Basically, Boyhood+Brokeback Mountain is set in an even worse and realistic environment. Although Cass is of all African descent, it is also feasible to change to white or Asian. In the previous film promotion, gay love was mostly used as a gimmick, but what really shocked me was the part of the hero who was bullied at school, at home and in society when he was a child. In the final analysis, this is the story of a boy growing up. The performance and the soundtrack are all outstanding.
