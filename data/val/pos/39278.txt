A brilliant play in Jin Yong's martial arts, but ignored by me; a play with the darkest tone and the most eerie plot design in Jin Yong's works; a well-produced film co-produced by the mainland and Hong Kong, but of a high standard! The play has a pessimistic view of human nature. For the sake of money, trust and affection between people, it becomes extremely fragile and disappears in an instant. Is an exaggerated version of real life.
