I have always believed that secret love is the most beautiful thing. Those silly little silent humble pay and persistence. Only one person's youth and love can be seen in his eyes. A small universe that is constantly changing and powerful enough to overcome everything for the sake of love. Even if the movie isn't perfect. But it is our youth! It's our memory!
