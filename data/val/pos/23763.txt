It should be the most exciting and cult rock movie last year. It may not be able to describe its madness with three "most" words: Jimi Hendrix, Michael Jackson and Kurt Cobain... The rock stars and celebrities mentioned or saluted in the film are almost all thunderous, and people who love rock and roll will at least watch it first. (both Sasayama and Miyazawa appeared, sighing)
