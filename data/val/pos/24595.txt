First, after watching "try Love before Marriage", and then go back to see "very much Love". Just finished watching "exclusive trial", it seems that only "my favorite" didn't watch the love series. At first glance, we will feel that Ye Nianchen is talking about pure love without impurities. In fact, he made us create a vacuum cleaner when we had some fantasies about love, sucking away the foam of love. The rest is naked truth or lies or betrayal. Astringent!
