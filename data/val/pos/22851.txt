No matter how seriously ill you are, don't treat the past as bitter. The truth is very simple. Only by learning to live, to find the sustenance of love, and to be filled with love and hope, can we be realistic about what we have and what we lose. After all, you still want to be an adult. You will be stylish and fun. Establish an independent and strong inner mind.
