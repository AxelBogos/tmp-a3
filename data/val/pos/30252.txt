Nice! The biography of Zuckerberg can be boring, but it's so interesting, the person is an interesting person himself, and the director's multi-line narrative promotes the plot and suits the story. The image of a nerd with fresh ideas pops up on the screen, especially the slippers. Jason is a good fit to play this kind of weird but highly intelligent man, who is Zuckerberg Beng.
