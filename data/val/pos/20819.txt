It is true that there are a lot of problems with the film. The large span of the timeline leads to the unsmooth convergence of the plot in many places, and many plots do not make sense (such as skipping school and watching the air show). Some supporting roles are funny and useless, and some lines say that the teaching flavor is also very strong. But in this film, I saw that the creator was sincere enough. They showed us the affection between father and son, and several places directly pierced the tears. They use the bet between Ma Haowen and Director Yan to explore the role of education, family education and school education, the pros and cons of examination-oriented education, what kind of education do we need? Does the cram school blindly attack Tsinghua University and Peking University? I am also very grateful to my father for not forcing me to get a high score and asking me to find my own point of interest. Many of my neighbors may not have a good evaluation, but I still want to recommend it. I may have my own shadow. There are many classic old songs on the soundtrack. The soundtrack of the scene of Bai Yu's Space Rescue is extremely tense, and the performance is not as awkward as the first two films. The acting skills are basically online, and the jokes are sometimes abrupt, but it is much better than Deng Yu's combination of the first two films. Give me an encouragement score. (8.5Accord 10)
