It was only later learned that the rare good domestic films were adapted based on director Ma Liwen's own personal experience. No wonder they have such a strong sense of substitution. The film has no story, but it is full of fragments of life, but it is extremely touching. But what puzzles me most is that the heart is so delicate and the feelings are so sincere that it shows why Ma Liwen, who has photographed the two of us and the person who loves me the most in the world, finally got lost on the road of commercial films.
