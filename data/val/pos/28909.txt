20190330 Xiao Xitian / six stories made up of Americans and Italians in Italy in the three years before the end of World War II, what is great about the film is that the film is based entirely on life, recording precious fragments of World War II, the director uses extremely limited resources to complete the expression frame of his inner ideas, a camera in the street contains the most direct information about people's lives in the street. Pull a small number of people to perform to present the most spiritual hearts after the war, in which the story is still very moving. I can't forget the last picture of the boy's eyes in the story of my favorite boy and black American army.
