I went to see two shows, each of which was sore in my eyes and sore in my face. it was a film with great heart, it was worth it, and every actor was worth it, very good!
There were two scenes that impressed the most, one was the flood, crying from beginning to end, the father shouted to his son hoarse, facing the unknown, he did not know whether his son was alive or dead, and he did not know anything, but he kept shouting with hope. At last I thought he was happy when I heard the whistle, the kind of extreme happiness, indescribable happiness.
In another game, when the horse finally flew out of the cabin to carry out the mission, he did not give him a "perfect" halo, he was bounced off, could not hold the grip, and so on, which attracted the whole audience to shout, and finally the successful return also drew applause from the whole audience.
There are a lot of jokes and tears throughout the article, the acting skills of the actors are all online, and the emotional treatment of the narrator is also in place.
The film echoes from beginning to end many times, and there are a lot of small details, some of which I haven't found yet, and I will brush them after release.
In short, a very attentive film, a film not only about family affection and education, is worth seeing.
