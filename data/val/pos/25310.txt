I like the first half very much, how beautiful the youth of the five girls is, they can play and play at the seaside and go to the football game in groups. The second half began to develop into a model, resisting religious morality and patriarchal oppression, and the outcome was nothing more than these. The eldest married the right man, the second gave in, the third gave himself up and committed suicide. The fourth and fifth fought hard and finally escaped from the cage, and Istanbul was beautiful at last in the morning light.
