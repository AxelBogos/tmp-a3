After taking a deep breath, I began to watch this masterpiece. Kobayashi Masagi I have not known how to praise, can only say that is the favorite Japanese director, the work from the end of the moment will continue to haunt me to become a part of life. (this film especially wants to marvel at the part about China, which is restored by God in various senses, and really has a very detailed understanding of China.
