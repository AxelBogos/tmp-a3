The track of growth is full of struggle, change, loss, looking back, although still did not come together with the original people in the end, but life is not like this? I didn't know about this film until many years after listening to Lao Wolf's "Love in the Wind and Dust". Its style is very appropriate. If you have ever looked back at your youth, you are recommended to see this movie.
