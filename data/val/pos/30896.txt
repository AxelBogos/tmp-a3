The blood of the machine just finished is very good-looking, and Brother Jackie Chan and Li Sen, who plays it, give us a different feeling. Luo Zhixiang made a joke again. Hailong Lu saw it very well. I knew for the first time that the structure of the Sydney Opera House was like that. I had never been to the Sydney Opera House, but it was thrilling to see Jackie Chan play on it. He was so high that he kept thinking about whether he would fall. There are also explosions and gunfights. I'm nervous and excited.
