I always feel that the tension of Joseph Gordon-Levitt 's face is limited and its plasticity is not strong. The plot is a little cliche. The children who play the Rain Master are very outstanding, and their words and actions are not ordinary people. The vision of the future of China is really very good, and the advertisements inside are also very good, hehe.
