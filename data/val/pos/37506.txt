Not love, better than love. The funeral is just right, the black is just right, and the warmth is just right. Some people say that there is no "cure system" film in China. Since then, there has been one. Look at this film, we laugh and cry. There are not a few realistic films depicting the characters at the bottom, but this is the one I have seen in recent years, with the most sincerity, the most positive values, and the most "sad but not hurt." You will fully feel what "real acting" means, and you will see how "top acting troupes" such as Chen Jianbin, Ren Suxi, Zhang Yu, Wang Yanhui and so on. I sincerely hope that from now on, domestic films will really usher in the spring of "good actors + good movies".
