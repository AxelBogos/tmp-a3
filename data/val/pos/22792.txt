Haruki Murakami said that Russians are good at speaking philosophical language, perhaps because they are used to thinking about relationships in winter. No matter how big the problem is, the Russians think that in December, January will always come. This epic Russian version of Life uses three clues to explore the true meaning of happiness, eulogizing the great Russian women, with a sense of comedy in the popular plot and the positive energy of the classics, as well as endless thinking space and a pleasant soundtrack.
