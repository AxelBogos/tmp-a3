Tearful. Quite understand the mentality of the male master, he lived a superior life, and began to miss his relatives who are far away from his parents. His adoptive parents are the big love. I can have children on my own, but in order to help poor children in India, I decided to give up having children and adopt children in need. I am very curious about the story after I met my birth mother, will it lead to a more bloody plot?
