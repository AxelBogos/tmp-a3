In the heart-wandering movie, the stodgy old man came out of the shadow of his wife's death through singing, which can be said to have changed the predicament of his old age. If people who watch this movie resonate, they can find a lot of tears. SOLO at the end of the best part is really distracted, and a tear comes out of his eyes. A movie that must get full marks.
