Mickey Locke's semi-autobiographical performance is shocking, and this is the biggest highlight of the film. As far as the plot is concerned, the script is neat, not bad, but not outstanding. I can see that Darren Aronofsky's strength is still in the control of the characters. To sum up, four stars.
