Unlike ordinary sports movies, which work hard all the way and finally get the right results, the theme of this film is profound, the struggle may not necessarily be successful, and the success may not be satisfactory. Frankie's moral dilemma in the latter half of the film elevates the film to a level that the same type of film has never set foot in. And why did the guy who finally returned to the gym come back with no talent and no energy to make it clear that he had nothing to do with success? Some people have the opportunity and some people don't, so what? who says people are born for success? To paraphrase: "A man must fulfill himself."
