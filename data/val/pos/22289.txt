A female medical student became a psychopath after being raped by her mentor (well, she didn't kill many people. ) and the story of a special plastic surgeon. I haven't seen such a bloody thing in years. I'm more or less shock, but the story is very tight, you can watch it, it's a bit like a B-rated horror movie in the 1970s.
