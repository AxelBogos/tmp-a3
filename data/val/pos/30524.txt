masterpiece! Almost every scene can be printed as a textbook for filming. There is no soundtrack, no computer special effects. Xi Fat teaches you to tell stories with the lens. You see the first scene, how humorous lovers meet; then watch the appearance of birds, step by step, from peace to fear; the discussion in the hotel, doubt, speculation, fear, fear, scaremongering, none of their own business. Say it again, masterpiece!
