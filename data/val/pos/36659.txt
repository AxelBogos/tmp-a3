The two Keatons are four years earlier than the two Chaplins in the Great Circus. When they enter the screen, there is a play in the play, and this editing technique is now timeless and original. Many scenes are scheduled at the textbook level. As a director, Keaton is brilliant, and as an actor, I am in awe.
