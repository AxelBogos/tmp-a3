When I saw it for the first time, I was too young. I agreed with Louis Koo and fell into a dead end. Now I feel very different. I agree with Fang Zhongxin that he is the real man.
The drama of Louis Koo is hateful and pathetic.
First, ignorant and incompetent, like Yang Gongru unexpectedly let her do nightclub, he is useless, destitute but self-righteous, causing a fight. He also directed Li Cansen to drive his car into Fang Zhongxin.
Second, Fang Zhongxin openly said that Yang Gongru could compete fairly, but he was always confused with Yang Gongru, and his subsequent revenge was largely due to jealousy.
Third, feeding Yang Gongru to take medicine, causing his lover to be raped to death in the street, this is the most pure and low-level mistake, and he is an idiot anyway.
