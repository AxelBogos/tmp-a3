The word "looking at the face" enhances the connotation of this work. To put it bluntly, it means "looking at the face". The word "Prime Minister" always reminds me more of "Prime Minister", "Prime Minister" and so on, so I have made this film which is a political struggle. People's good and evil loyalty can be seen from their faces, but how can individuals go against the advancement of history? Few of the Korean historical films I have seen are particularly heavy at first, always funny at the beginning, and at the stage of political struggle in the middle.
