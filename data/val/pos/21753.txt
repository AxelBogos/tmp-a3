Death and taxation are two things that cannot be escaped in a lifetime. Take control of your life so that you can not be manipulated by life. Even if in the end there is still no escape from death, death becomes meaningful because of the different meaning of life. When you understand the beauty and meaning of life, "when you know you are going to die but face it calmly", maybe miracles will happen. Life is full of Bavarian sugar cookies that keep people alive. "I think I can accept'OK'."
