The electronic music composed by the Norwegian contemporary Sami impromptu music group LEAGUS is getting better and better. The first half of the music does not fit well, and the second half adds a lot of color to the scene of dancing. There are a lot of black humorous segments in the film. Zhu Bajie's guillotine play is full of CULT flavor, and the atmosphere of the wedding scene is full of demons. The action play design seems to have absorbed the essence of many traditional Chinese dramas, and many details are also worth pondering. At the end, there is some melancholy mood. Pity these erotic goblins. Monkeys are weak and ferocious, but they are somewhat of a villain. (75)
