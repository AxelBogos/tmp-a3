When Zhang Yibai was closest to Wong Kar-wai, he was very delicate about the feelings of alienation between men and women in the city. Fragmented editing plus a large number of inner monologues, lyric soundtrack is as strong as emotion. By contrast, it makes the later "hurried year"passing by your world" into a laughingstock. Anyway, I love this movie. Because I love spring, I love subway, I love Beijing. I love love. I love the joy in the depths of love, and the despair in which I can no longer love.
