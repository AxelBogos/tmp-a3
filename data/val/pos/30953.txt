It's definitely the best of the three. Sorin has a lot of inner activities, and he still likes this role best. Everyone spelled out the last movie, the appearance broke through the sky, and the special effects were a little distressing. I can't get over it at the end. I have to see the Lord of the Rings again to ease it.
