It's much better than expected and won't lose money on the ticket. Looking at the past, the rhythm of the special effects is tight. Wu Ye is funny and funny. He really wants to hit him several times. He simply wants to be taught a lesson. His lines are very smooth and he looks really tender. The story is different from the book, half of Shufen, not obsessed with the original, so I think it's not bad. I don't want to judge, so I'll take it as the original movie. A Ning is very handsome! It's cool! I like it.
