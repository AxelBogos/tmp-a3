I didn't see enough of the play to go home and continue to browse the movie. The most heartbreaking thing about gangster movies is the role of eternal father, the softness of violence, and the call of children and women. Like the discussion of race in the movie: the strengthening of group consciousness and individual reluctance. Many people are blind and can only be told what beauty is. The adaptation of Broadway musicals purifies the plot. Music is the purest in the world. It can only express love but not hatred.
