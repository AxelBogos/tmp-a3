A movie. A movie. The way Keaton entered the movie screen is magical. Is this the so-called dream trust? The out-of-body Keaton's five-star performance on the cinema screen! Fantasy-Images, switching between different scenes, transmitted through the same posture. Keaton's running away! The switch between Keaton in the frame and the characters on the screen, from screen to screen. Five-star recommendation!
