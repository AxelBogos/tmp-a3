The heroine's singing is very beautiful, the hero's eyes are very affectionate, I can't imagine that he still has such a side in Nikita. Although the story is not too ups and downs, but it is very warm and moving. This is what love should look like. At first it felt impossible, but then I couldn't control myself not to get close.
