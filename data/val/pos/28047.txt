Although I really want to complain about the angel role in the movie starring Cage. But looking at the gentle eyes of Cage and the hostess, I feel that this more than 1 hour is worth it, the routine is not deep, it is the kind of film that can guess the ending soon, but it always makes people want to finish it. This is probably Cage's charm.
