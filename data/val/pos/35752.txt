I finally understand why I often hear people say that Douban's score can only be used as a reference. A movie with a compact plot, strong action and a good laugh got only 3.5 points. Fortunately, I watched the movie first and then reviewed it, or I missed a wonderful domestic movie. I'm looking forward to the next episode.
