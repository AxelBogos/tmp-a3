It's much better than I thought. I was misled by the poster, but I still like the one where four people sit side by side. The rhythm is a little slow, but not dull.
I haven't read the original cartoon, so I don't know what kind of character setting is in the original work, but I think the four leading actors still find their respective positions. Loli & simple and honest uncle, fat Zhengtai & imperial sister, such a match is very appropriate. The uncle who bought the umbrella is the original author?
