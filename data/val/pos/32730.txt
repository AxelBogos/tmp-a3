A prequel to the one-year War. It was announced in 2012 and will not be released until 2015. In recent years, we have been constantly reproducing and enriching the themes of the UC generation, probably not only to sell toys, but also to take care of some people's nostalgia. As time goes by, the youngest of the first generation of UC party is almost 40 years old. This play, supervised by my favorite an Yanliang and personally, is super five-star both in quality and emotionally.
