In the plot, 1998 fierce bandits from the mainland come to the port, killing and looting every evil, and it is very difficult not to have political associations. In the story, there are two gangsters, a team of policemen, two love lines in the main triangle and multiple angles, and the stage drama of the gun strategy (especially the last paragraph). Ren Dahua made do with the casting, but he didn't seem to be very much in the play. Meng Jiahui, who is in her twenties, is definitely the protagonist. Liu Qingyun is very good, and Xu Shaoxiong's shooting god is excellent. The soundtrack is excellent.
