[B+] in today's film industry, Wes Anderson should be a weirder director than Quentin. The reason is that the style of his personal film is so distinct that it seems to be the only one in the world. His films do not belong to any era, any culture, or any country. Even if the movie points out the specific background, its personal style can still be above the cultural symbols. Another lovely thing is the emotional expression in his movies, which can be seen in the lens language: whether it is symmetrical composition or translation mirror, the existence of the lens in these characters seems to be always neutral, floating on the surface, but deep. Anyway, this kind of rare and strange work is really rare now, so watch and cherish it.
