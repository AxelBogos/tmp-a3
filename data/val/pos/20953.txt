I have always liked Hiromo Ryoko, who is the most favorite of all Japanese women, but this play can actually be better. I always feel that directors and actors, including writers, can do better and be more detailed. It's a pity. Many Japanese dramas are very good, but I think we can do better. I am this kind of bitch, Excelsior.
