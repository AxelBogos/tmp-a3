First of all, the fact that villains are not idiots is already worth a score of 9. I'm really tired of all the villains' brains like paramecium. Not to mention Kim does not have a lover, the feeling of cowardice, caution and fear of breaking in front of love of the most powerful and brutal people is really good at making fried eggs for their loved ones. Then, characterization is now the peak or ceiling of all Marvel. All the characters, I mean all the protagonists and supporting characters, except the M\ P\ K protagonist trio, there are Nadeem, Dex, and even the president, priests and nuns, growing up, tangling, redemption, very good. The best part of the development of the story is the low ebb, the tone is scarlet and dark, and it's very cool. At the end of the Reunion, but there is a new suspense, really can.
