I don't know what ⊙∀⊙ I've seen. The version is said to be the 82-minute version of CCTV and the 99-minute version of Douban. I downloaded a version of less than 95 minutes online. It seems that the extreme version is also a favorite for watching movies. Maybe the Hong Kong version of VCD or DVD is different, so watch and cherish it. If I see a more complete version, it is now 1:34:51 (equal to 95 minutes or so) so-called repair version.
