There are really not many masterpieces of underworld films in the past two years, and this one is very good. The boss said that the corner is not a triad, but a group of young people with a great sense of justice. To put it another way, it seems that the left Azure Dragon, the right white tiger, the old cow on the waist, the bibcock on the chest, the Buddha blocking the Buddha, and a pair of double flowers and big red sticks in front of the door. Hearing "it will be dark, people will change; everything is fate, not a bit of people" suddenly associated with "friends talk about feelings, society talks about the market" in "Big Buddha Plath", and the famous sentence "I'll be in charge here after 12:00!" The navy's governor, Chang Wei, finally won the half of the court. Pretentious, pawn. "madame" is always Cai pain.
