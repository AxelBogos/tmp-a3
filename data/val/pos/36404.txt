The anti-genre of Cult film, judging from the degree of laughter of other audiences in my scene, you may not be aware of the bloodshed of this film at all. If you say that shameless bastards decriminalize allied violence, Quentin performs perfectly in the task of justifying violence at the end of the film. Secondly, the nature of the dream in this film is also in line with the era it pays attention to, various salutes are easy to grasp, the performance of Xiao Li is constantly interrupted by forgetting words, and the atmosphere of the five people in the room at the end of the film is weird and inconsistent with the facts. The audience shuttles back and forth between the real and the illusory. The film is telling the story of western actors and their stand-ins, the film itself is also a western, Peter's mysterious and legendary background, almost invincible martial arts, insipid but not cynical attitude, that is, the heroes in the western. Hippies are worms parasitic on the land of the proletariat under the camera, but they bully the good and fear the evil, which is also a common villain in the western.
