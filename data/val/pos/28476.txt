Although the space is a little slow, I feel that Chen Kaige has done nothing this time. He simply told a story written by Xu Haofeng. So it seems that I am just a big fan of Xu Haofeng. Chinese Wushu needs Xu Haofeng, literature needs Xu Haofeng, and movies need it more. Because you can do it well only if you know it. Xu Haofeng knows all three.
