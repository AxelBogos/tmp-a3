You know what's going on in this piece is enough to understand; love? Neither the essential freedom nor the inexhaustible freedom should be looked down upon, but there is no way to solve the deep suffering of those who hover there; there is no need for any simile, no one will understand you at all, and explicit similes will not be accepted at the same time; death, love is the most powerless and most ungrateful. Another: on the road, you only need one person forever.
