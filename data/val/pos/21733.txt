I didn't expect to see another good wife in such a short time. When the framework is so similar, it is better than Glenn in every way. The image of an independent "unorthodox" female writer is well presented, and for the complexity of the marital relationship, the film uses several plots of polygonal love to set off at least people understand. It was easy for Keira Knightley to complete such a role.
