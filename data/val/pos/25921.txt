In a word: ordinary moved. Another sentence: Be present. I have the impression that most modern American movies, good or bad, have a delicate and artificial communication. I dare say that this film has been overcome, maybe. There are two types of movies: original good films, bad imitations, and I think there is a third, critical film. This movie is cool, a good interpretation of some of the graduates did not have time to discuss. I just vaguely hope that there will be another ending.
