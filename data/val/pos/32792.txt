I hate Zhang Weijian very much, acting like pointing around with a straight face and a cool face. Zhang Weijian's monkey and Xiao Bao all have a lot of traces of imitation, and they all act very much like Stephen Chow. Zhang Weijian proved Zhou Xingchi's success. Wei Xiaobao is Jin Yong's virtual role, but from the beginning of this film, I think that Wei Xiaobao should be played by Stephen Chow. Chen Jinnan's interpretation of the anti-Qing Dynasty and the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, together with Duolong, are all classic. Qiu Shuzhen's Jianning is also very outstanding.
