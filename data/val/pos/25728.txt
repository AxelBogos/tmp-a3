It is not easy for this group of grass-roots film and television workers to survive the boredom and futility of the first 40 minutes. I wish Chinese crew could be so dedicated to their work. This low-cost production also reminds me of the experience of taking the Shanghai team to the company film festival. Well, thank you again.
