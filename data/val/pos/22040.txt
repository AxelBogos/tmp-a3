I feel that Cai Kangyong is a brave new director, and it is very difficult for the new director to film the whole story. Because most of the middle class who are old enough to join the circle of directors just want to play with tickets and are keen on all kinds of fancy skills and dexterity, such films are much fresher by comparison. The four stars encourage and keep up their efforts.
