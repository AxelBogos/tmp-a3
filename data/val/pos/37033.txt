Well-made small-cost suspense film, good dialogue, proper rhythm, a clue throughout, reminds me of the same type of truth or adventure I saw some time ago, one day, one earth, this absolute value of four stars, one more star to raise points ps is sure to see too many movies of the same type, see the first clue there basically guess the direction of the plot, but there are still some amazing places The screenwriter is powerful.
