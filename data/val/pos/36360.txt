It is full of the smell of childhood. I miss Beijing when I was young, Beijing, where I took a bath in a bathhouse, and Beijing, where my father could release pigeons to listen to whistles. Noodles soybean paste ate a bowl of Beijing with cucumbers, and the walls of the old hutong rowed across Beijing where sand would fall. The continuous development of more and more prosperous, although I do not adapt, but I still love here.
