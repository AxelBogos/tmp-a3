You are young and tough, and if I talk to you about war, you can throw Shakespeare at me and recite "Let's go to War, Dear friend", but you've never been to battle, never tried to hold your best friend's head in your arms, and watched him take his last breath and stare at you and ask you for help. Don't think I know you. Maybe I can see you through "knowledge", but that's not you. Unless you're willing to talk about yourself, I don't know who you are.
