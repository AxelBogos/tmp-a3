Denzel Washington showed all his inner activities in his eyes, the helplessness of the verdict, the loss of failed appeals, the despair of talking to lawyers through the window, and the joy of freedom. He shows it all with his eyes, and he is worthy of the movie star! It was a very moving film with a happy ending.
