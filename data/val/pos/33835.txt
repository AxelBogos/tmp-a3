I didn't notice Matsuyama coming out. The game is very simple ~ BOSS is very bad simply by cheating ~ but it still looks good ~ our society is too kind to our teenagers, even if we know me, it hasn't changed much ~ because we don't feel that every decision is a game of life. One star to Fujiwara ~ two stars to Mitaro ~ one star to the queen of Tianhai ~ one star to YUI music!
