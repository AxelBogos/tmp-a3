When the ghost movie was downloaded, it turned out to be in love. I think, theme. Photography, acting, structure, can all reach 5 stars. The flaw is that the ending is a little hasty, too much. To describe the human nature in the extreme state, there is still a gap between Sodom's 120 days and us Easterners. In addition, many scenes in Red Sorghum are probably stolen from this film.
