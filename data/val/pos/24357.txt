Revise the previous comments, and say sorry to my friends who like Shileng. I seriously underestimated Guoman. I was not mature enough before, and I rejected it when I saw the advertisement. (PS: the main reason that caused me to revise the comment is that when I went to bilibili today to review the ten cold, I found that the ten cold had gone off the shelves. Needless to say, some things only lost, you will find how good he is. )
