This shallow and childish film is actually only at the level of a TV movie. The film is not interested in discussion, but just wants to ask the historical facts: in the film, Churchill before the D-Day was a mother endlessly for the risk of action and the possible casualties of his soldiers, torturing himself, not to mention interfering with Eisenhower's command, but finally woke up by the words of the female secretary and made that famous speech. This can't be true, is it?
