It is also a film with values and emotional tendencies that I disagree with. The two brothers, who have strong hands and strong feet, do not rely on their own hands and intelligence to get rich by hard work, but use bank robberies to keep their ancestral property in order to dig oil and make a fortune, and make it look like they are forced to steal from Liangshan or steal, making it both sensational and poetic. Bah! In addition, the actors of the two brothers should be swapped, and Chris Pine can only be seen as a pervert.
