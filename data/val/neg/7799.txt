Greatly disappointed, do not know what to say, extremely disappointed in Chen Guo. Whether the so-called local movies or political metaphors are complete nonsense, the criticism and mockery of reality is incomparably stiff. From the point of view of film creation, it is a complete failure. There is no need to halve the original film. The character is out of touch with the plot, and there is a model of failure in which everything is put in the box.
