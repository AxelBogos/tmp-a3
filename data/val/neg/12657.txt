How high are the early expectations of this film, and how disappointed I am when I watch it knowing that the quality is not amazing. In fact, he has a strong and concave relationship with the previous Rohan series, which is nothing more than a Clooney's sister, Ross's father, and the last Chinese acrobat. But the loophole in the whole game is so big that I may not be found out if I can get through it directly. The movie must be a fake, but when I watched Lohan 11 / 13, it didn't give people such an absurd sense of "who believes you lied to a fool when you played jb?" All the girls are all right, Hathaway is obviously not a girl, and Sister Banana is really overshadowed by the Devil and Sandra. Is Sandra giving a little too much injection?
