The worst one in shit! There is no one! As the first movie at the beginning of the year, it really made my intestines repentant. Plot routines, performance idiocy, agency simplification! Completely ignore that the protagonist is a primate, and the love triangle is going to die? Saw sister-in-law before a few more magnificent, instantly like eating brain fragments, but also run so jubilant â€¦... What's even more shameful is that it's still in suspense, your sister! Smash the sign!
