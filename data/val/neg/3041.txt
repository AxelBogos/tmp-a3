@ balmes screenwriter is mentally retarded, will you die if you shoot according to the original?! After the blind reform, the reason for the murderer's crime was completely unfounded, and the detection of what should have been a rigorous and intricate case turned into a child's play. In the end, the confrontation scene was hilarious. How could I pronounce such a second-grade line? At the same time, the writer is very good at writing people to death, so he can arrange for the murderer to be killed, and several characters that extend to other works can also be written to death.
