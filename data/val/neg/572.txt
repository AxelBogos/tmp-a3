This... The plot is too messy. I'm in a hurry to get to the next part before I finish what I've said. The acting skill of the lead actor is not as good as that of the supporting role. I guessed that the director wanted to express three lines... Hispanics're-understanding of their identity, the emotional line between the two protagonists, and their understanding of material values. Although I understand, but the director you did not say yes.
