The child is said by the doctor to be suffering from schizophrenia, has ghost eyes, can see ghosts, and the doctor is actually a ghost? This is the first time, I was confused, and I read some comments and forums below. Compared with "Beautiful mind", I thought that both the child and the doctor suffered from the disease, and the doctor's wife died, that is, Anna was a ghost.
