There is no complaining, this film is definitely a masterpiece, fighting like dancing, Little Loli can still be with uncle, and finally the emotional play between Little Brother and Little Lori has not been explained clearly. This is the worst film I have ever seen this year. I don't seem to have thought of it for the time being.
