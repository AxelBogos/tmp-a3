I was surprised at 8 points. I gave a short review as usual. I chose the last 20 people with four or five stars to watch the reviews. Of the 20 high scores, 12 had only seen this film, and three had only seen two or three movies. The victory of the water army, and I can only silently send a star to balance the water army. PS, a day later became 6.9, and then click on the last ten 4-5 star evaluation, 7 pure water army, 1 suspected water army, but the water army can not save bad movies.
