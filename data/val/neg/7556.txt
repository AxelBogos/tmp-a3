I finally saw the film once. Explicit propaganda of party spirit, false description of officialdom and poor performance make people unable to look directly at it. Only the performance of the leading actor is remarkable.
No matter how much of the plot in the film is true, Wu Renbao is really a talented person to develop an ordinary village into the number one village in the world in that environment.
