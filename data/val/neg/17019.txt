Not satisfied with the casting, Chen Kun is not like Hu Bayi at all! It might be better for Xia Yu to play Hu Bayi, but even the big golden tooth is not sure, it's too noisy! Huang Bo played the fat man better than expected, acting as if the fat man had become the number one man. Shu Qi is more like Yang than Yao Chen. The role of Liu Xiaoqing is so inexplicable.
