This messy hodgepodge of plot plus speechless special effects ðŸ˜“ wants to give half a star to the hard-working staff. After reading the original work, I knew at the beginning that everything was different except the name, so I watched it with the attitude of watching the new film. What kind of film do I want to make? Suspense? Scary? Science fiction? Love? It's nothing. After all, I have read a novel and suddenly found that there are still many actors I like to make movies. I am disappointed. After watching the whole film, what I remember most clearly is the film that applauded for love at the beginning, and no matter how good the acting could not save. Made a rustic fantasy thriller in Budapest.
