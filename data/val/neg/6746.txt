A typical American comedy, a stereotyped woman, a heavy-mouthed woman who passionately collides with swearing and then loves each other without creativity. There is nothing but dirty words and dirty jokes. Do you understand that in the United States, the police are not regarded as disciplined services that do not act in accordance with the laws and regulations? Although American movies have been promoting lonely heroism whose superiors are as stupid as pigs and subordinates try to turn the tide, if this were the case, the police system would have been paralyzed and hated this kind of movies.
