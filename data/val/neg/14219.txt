It's ugly. At the beginning of talking about going into the water, I wondered, is this a movie without lines? Okay, this is solved. Then I wondered, there is no light in the deep sea, what am I looking at? Then I saw a light on the cage and solved. Did you get it? No, no! The whole film is dark most of the time. I can't see anything. And then American girls like to bark. Now I have joined the series of "if I really don't know what to do, I'll probably die".
