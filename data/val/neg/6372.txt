No matter how hot the stir-fry is, you will be disappointed. The consistent style of American TV series is complex, multi-line and multi-stem, bloody and violent, and the so-called discussion of human nature. However, there are not many positive things to be found, but some domestic audiences like it. It seems that they can understand how high their IQ is and how worthy to show off. It is just a good show. I just want to ask, what is so good?
