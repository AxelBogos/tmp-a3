After watching it, I only remember France and the jungle in the studio. This work is obviously more patriotic than storytelling. There are many stars, but each is reduced to soy sauce. Propaganda outweighs content. The heroine is really weak. The beginning is really inexplicable! No matter how many colored eggs can not make up for the hard wound of the plot!
