The whole film is too far-fetched by the director, completely for the needs of the director and the development of the plot, there are too many unreasonable places. It goes without saying that Mrs. Wu's poor acting skills are needless to say. Bai Binzu was psychotic again. Originally, I was full of joyful expectations, but unexpectedly there were too many shadows of a beautiful soul, so I jumped out unwittingly, comparing Russell Crowe and Ah Zu. Be careful next time.
