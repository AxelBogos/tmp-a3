Ken Watanabe's line is a little more credible, gay line and Okinawa line are too strange, nightclub casually pick up a stranger home to raise, desert island to see a weirdo also go to get close to him, Japanese friends are really so unguarded? Forgive me for being vulgar and unable to appreciate elegant blockbusters. What I can't appreciate is the appearance of Ayano.
