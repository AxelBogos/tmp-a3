The trace of Eddie's performance is a little heavy, so he doesn't like it very much. Directly challenging heights that have never been practiced at the 1988 Olympic Games is not about participation, but about playing with your life and setting a new British record. Like what flying fin said to Eddie, if we don't challenge, how can people see that such a big man who continues to lead mankind to break through the limits is really respectable?
