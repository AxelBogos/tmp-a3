This is an age of venomous tongues. If you want to kill people who are ignorant, ignorant, indecent, entertaining, selfish, obscene, greedy and shameless, you might as well kill yourself first. after all, everyone is guilty of seven deadly sins, but ironically, you don't have the courage to commit suicide, but you have the courage to kill yourself. This is a cool-looking movie, but in fact it is very skinny and very superficial.
