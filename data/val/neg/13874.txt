I thought there would be a large-scale and creepy exorcism at last. It turned out to be a theme movie in the end. The Japanese government really seems to be worried about the low fertility rate. To make matters worse, apart from advocating the innocence of the child, he did not provide any advice for resolving family conflicts. Chicken ribs. Minus one star for that. # the witch sister is still very handsome, the biggest highlight of the whole film
