It's rare that segmented movies make me think that every story is smelly and long. The first man who caught fire in the Chinese New year dance dance believed that the heroine was not burned to death. As a result, both of them were burned to death, and all kinds of acting skills and plots were impeccably stupid. I don't know what was said at the end of the second story, that is, a prisoner hit a ghost and hanged himself. In the third story, the big one is a little stronger. The drug (river crab) dealer killed the woman by mistake and dumped the body in the top floor water tank. The residents drank hair and dead skin and fingernails one after another, although they pulled a little bit. The fourth is Thailand's signature comedy horror film, in which two men find women standing on the street to the hotel, all kinds of haunted, and it turns out that the two men are ghosts.
