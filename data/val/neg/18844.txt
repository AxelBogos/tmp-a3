The gimmick is full of gimmicks. I don't want to call it the imagination of romanticism. I think it's a clever thought that is greatly inspired. Xiaoqing's new humor, coupled with the jumping rhythm, still failed to make me really integrate into the world of the film. This embarrassment stems from the immature setting, the lightness and elegance of the groundless imagination, which looks beautiful, but that's all. Minus one star pull score.
