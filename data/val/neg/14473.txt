At the beginning, the pace is too fast, a lot of things are fast forward. It's legendary, amazing, and the plot is old-fashioned, and there are a bunch of routines that have difficulties and then overcome them, such as falling behind and then winning, getting hurt first and then overcoming them, losing hope and then being summoned suddenly. In this movie, the goalkeeper has never guarded the ball once. It's a complete decoration. At first I hurt my foot so badly, and then I was like a normal person.
