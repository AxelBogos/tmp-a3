Sit all over the screen... Basically, it is still an old problem of domestic comedy. If you come up with a setting, you will feel that everything is all right, the characters, details, and logic will not be taken seriously, and the result will be an empty shell in vain. You may say that it is good to have a good appearance, which is better than many domestic films. The point is, brother Xiao Yangge, this is a comedy, and it doesn't matter if the special effects are shot poorly, do you at least have to be funny? But it really just... It's not funny... The whole thing is still the Northeast Errenzhuan, and the Queen Mother has a program. It's not too much to say zero punchline. In the future, if we can be a director at will, we will at least hold back the screenwriter. Can't we be down-to-earth?
