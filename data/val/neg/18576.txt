The Blu-ray version of District An in the United States, when I look at it again, I think it is still a typical American commercial film, and the plot of the movie is as retarded as the general commercial film. At that time, the production of commercial films was quite sincere, and the Chinese and English fonts at the beginning of the film were very modern, and the picture was not bad. After all, the director changed from photography to photography, and he had done photography of "Speed of Life and death" before. PS: it's a pity that the heroine died young
