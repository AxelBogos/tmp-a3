Do not know how the score can be so high, an hour is 2D animation and playing tricks, the director is not sincere at all. When SpongeBob became a muscle Superman, the so-called 3D film became impotent after a long 2D prelude. Fortunately, there was a wuli soundtrack in the end, otherwise I would definitely refund the ticket, but the five-or six-year-old watched it very attentively.
