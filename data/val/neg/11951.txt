This film can not be moved, even if the animation can not copy the first one without innovation. The plot is really not as good as the first film, very naive without attracting the eye spot. I feel that this more than an hour's film is very mechanically copied. The turning point is not natural. I wouldn't be able to watch it if it wasn't for that big pile of transparent shit.
