This film is so pathetic that I can feel that both the creator and the behind-the-scenes special effects are completely stifled by "box office pressure". It is so pitiful that I even think that this film will become an immortal classic in the cult film industry decades or a hundred years later! But the film is so pathetic that I still accidentally regard him as a CG cartoon with apocalyptic themes such as the Walking Dead.
