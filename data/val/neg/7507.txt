This is a government film of the Communist Party of China. To tell you the truth, the final outcome of the eight-year War of Resistance depends on many internal and external factors, and it is impossible to win or even fight a large-scale war by relying on tunnel warfare and so on. The film tries to simplify history with deliberately rendered pictures so as to achieve the goal of fooling the people, which is disgusting and even sinister.
