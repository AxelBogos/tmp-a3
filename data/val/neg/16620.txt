A tedious experience of watching movies. It is estimated that the writer's composition was not good when he was a child, and he was not good at narrating and laying the groundwork. Using only a small amount of space to establish a character relationship so that the emotional connection is fragile and without a sense of substitution, he began a crazy close-up inner play of his facial features, and Jiang Wu's big face was extravagant to the end. The central idea of such a story should be the conflict of values brought about by the switching of life, not just the choice of relatives.
