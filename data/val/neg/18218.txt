Although it is a biographical film, in fact, there is no biography to speak of, as if the director emphasizes and creates an atmosphere, a comfortable atmosphere that haunts the shadow of war. The beautiful natural scenery and the beautiful body of the young girl have become so unreal. Ambiguous, pointless, irrelevant literature and art. I don't like the strange children in the movie, and I don't like the look of the loser riffraff when such a beautiful girl walks.
