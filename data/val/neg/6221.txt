Everywhere is fragmented, mixed together powerless, very scattered. The repeated slow motion lost its responsibility to set off the heavy emotions of the characters, turning it into a feather that kept sweeping my eyes and driving me crazy. The performances of Lucas Hedges and Nicole Kidman are layered and worth savoring, but the truncated emotional collage shows that they are rehearsing variety sketches. Why didn't the crew change the look of Troye Sivan? Pop culture elements seriously upset the balance of stories. And the choice of episode makes the film look like an extended version of the story MV for songs of poor quality of pop idols. It doesn't make sense. It really doesn't make sense.
