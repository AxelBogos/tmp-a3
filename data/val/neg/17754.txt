The funny point is too bad. I shot a story against the worship of money with the whole style of worship of money. I originally thought that if my aunt did not fall in love with the male master, it would be very happy, but it was a pity to let me down. My aunt was shining all over her eyes when the male master lambasted everyone for worshiping money. In this case, I am afraid that YY stallion harem novels are rarely written. I am on pins and needles.
