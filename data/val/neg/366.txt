The last time I saw the 4:3 movie, it seemed to be the Budapest Hotel. This may be a good movie. I don't like the rhythm of the movie. I don't like what I want to say, but I think it doesn't matter. I don't need to fast-forward in ten minutes. Ps, I gave a star because I don't like to think about it. After all, this is my own Douban pps hot comment. I'm going to become a spring knife. Being held up in the sky is just a hint of something.
