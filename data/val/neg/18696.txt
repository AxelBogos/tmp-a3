The whole thing is like a pot of raw rice.
The script structure of the chapter novel, the section title of the biblical story, the transition mode of the home video, the creativity in many details of the film has the texture of postmodern art-insinuating the diseases of American society through the life history of an actress, and expressing intentions such as gun control, abortion, racism and terrorism: unfortunately, the story itself did not fall to the ground, and the characterization of the characters is superficial. The content design with expressive function is too deliberate and has a serious sense of patchwork. Coupled with the excessive scribbling of narration rather than the film itself, it ends up looking as uncomfortable as a rough piece.
In fact, the two sections do not matter who is better, each has a good paragraph, Raffey Cassidy and Natalie Portman's performances are also worthy of attention, but the two are too different in terms of image, temperament and acting methods, and the Portman after their appearance feels like a collapse: not only because of the script, but also because of poor casting.
In addition, the so-called "musical feature film" is obviously supposed to be based on music, but the musical material of the whole film is so thin, which is particularly disappointing.
