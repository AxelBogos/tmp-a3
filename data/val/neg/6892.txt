Xiaobai has several questions: 1) does such a similar plot setting really need a screenwriter? 2) the biggest change it has made is to turn the classic into a local one? 3) I have no aversion to actors, so this star is for actors. 4) I want to give Yoga Lin a star, but the show itself is too ruined to give it to me. Finally, this movie can be regarded as one of my destruction classics, but thank you for letting us see the gap!
