1, either go to tmd science, or seriously respect science, pretend to be pseudoscience to fool people is very annoying; 2, lazy, many flashbacks are copied documentaries (see "Wild Africa" and "reincarnation", there should be others) 3, the protagonist is too strong, the villain is too weak, the protagonist is weak for no reason â€¦ You don't have to be so fooling.
