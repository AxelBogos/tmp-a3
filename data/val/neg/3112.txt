I don't know if domestic films have broken through the upper limit. The lower limit in the past two years is getting farther and farther away. It took four years to go from "living in Fuchun Mountain" to "Dream-chasing Entertainment Circle", but it only took two years to produce another "Legend of Zhu Bajie". This work almost completely breaks through the limits of human intelligence and deconstructs the film history with a wonderful aesthetic. No matter how you use your brain, you can't understand the behavior of every character in the movie and any connection between every line. The editing of the almost complete stream of consciousness makes time and space chaotic, shuttling wantonly between the bottom of the sea, the heavenly palace, and the world. But everywhere is like purgatory to refine the audience's nerves, forcing the eye to see all unacceptable aesthetic props. From the time the giant baby named the young god talked to the protagonist in the sky, I knew that the film was completely mocking the 2001 space rover and everything in the history of the film. So what if the character's mouth shape and lines don't match, it's like the audience can't keep up with the screenwriter's leaping brain circuit.
