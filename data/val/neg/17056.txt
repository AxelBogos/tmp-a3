Full of loopholes, the heroine halo was too strong, and finally he went through the train with Zheng Yusheng, but how could a ruthless character on the road keep hostages? if the heroine wasn't the hostess, she should have died a long time ago. Zheng Yusheng is still handsome in front, and the one who dies behind is too casual. "win if you're crazy" is funny. There are still too many overall trough points. It is also inexplicably superfluous for the woman in the middle to fight to save lives. The plot is not tight enough.
