It's so tangled. The last thing I can't stand for a photographer like me is the noise. I was asked to watch the noise in the cinema, then the Chinese dubbing and then the full price (although it wasn't paid for by me). As soon as I looked at the man's cell phone, I thought it wouldn't be a movie from a few years ago. I can't believe I got it right again.
