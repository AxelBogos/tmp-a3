Today, for the first time to know that Lisa is a member of Hong Kong independence and Tibetan independence, or a follower of the Dalai Lama, I can't help but tear it up with her on ins, but I definitely don't regret it. Any artist who tries to split China is not worthy of being followed by Chinese fans. Besides, apart from the filters of these two films, she really has nothing to chase. She doesn't have any thoughts and depth in her usual news. She dares to talk nonsense and support Hong Kong independence when she knows nothing about China. What qualifications and positions does she have? she will not say much about her life.
