The storyline is too weak to grasp the rhythm of the story, and there is a big problem in allocating the rules of the account and the length of the main story. The cat teacher excessively grabs the scene, so that the arc of the characters of Xia Mu and prey Xiong is almost zero, which is really not as good as the animation. It may be that they do not have a thorough understanding of Japan's "debt" culture and do not have a good understanding of the behavior of monsters. But the monsters described in the theme are more emotional than people and pay more attention to the spirit of contract, and the fetters of human emotions are not as good as ugly demons. Unfortunately, the director wants to make an empty hell, demons in the world, merciless monsters in the world, warm healing films that hinder our lives with irreplaceable good memories, streetcars, forests, sunsets, kites, all the healing elements have been used, but unexpectedly, it has been made into a political metaphorical play of the loss of old women, the absence of the government and the replacement of monsters. The same story about the loss of independence, may also be able to fight with Wang Xiaoshuai's "forever" at the end of the month. Disappointed. [sad]
