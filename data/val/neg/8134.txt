Disappointing, the story logic is very unreasonable, probably because the protagonist is a child forced to pretend to be naive, but become a failure, the fight with the villain does not have a little sense of advanced, seems very boring, even to kill the villain is also killed in a boring way. The initial expectations may be too high to lead to this attitude, to tell you the truth than the Sea King is not more than one grade, disappointing film.
