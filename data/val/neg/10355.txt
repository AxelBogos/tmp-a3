Oh, my God, my mom only likes pornographic movies. The 13-year-old foreign version of Wang Sicong has a warm and ambiguous story with a frustrated work family and a poor young babysitter with a musical dream. In order to cater to our female donors, the man's stepfather does business in Beijing, and the woman also takes the man to eat Chinese food with monosodium glutamate. That's awesome!
