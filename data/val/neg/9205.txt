The hurt words series is so bad, so disgusting. I was deceived so miserably by Douban's score for the first time. The plot is so rubbish. It's too tm to be logical. There are so many loopholes that I don't want to give examples. Why is the score of such a rubbish movie so high? I don't know if I can give it a score of 0.01 to lower the score. We can't let this movie deceive people with such a high score.
