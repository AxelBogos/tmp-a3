There is nothing Satan can do about the curse of destruction of the Tathagata, not to mention that you can't even beat the governor, and Fa Hai takes pictures in front of you. After so many millennia, I haven't succeeded once. Maybe someone is joking. Even if you succeed, you can't beat the Terminator anyway, because the Terminator will end you. The final time is only 3 seconds. Is it self-deprecating?
