Friendly tip: this film is only dedicated to those who have not watched "Hurricane Rescue"!
A few days ago, I inadvertently saw the propaganda of this film on CCTV 6, and I knew at first glance that it was a knockoff! ~ well, you copy it, please change your lines, even the plot has not changed at all! ~ depending on some special effects shots of action, it's like selling! Isn't the director afraid of being splashed when he goes out tomorrow?
