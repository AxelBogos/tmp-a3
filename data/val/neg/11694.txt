I like a lot of details, but I almost feel that it should not be so bad. I wanted to go to the cinema to support it, but I have been disgusted with all kinds of money in this company since 1. I didn't want to pay attention to it any more. It's not too ugly, but it's much worse than the first one, and I can no longer accept the setting of letting Kuiba beat his own people. Your warm-blooded touching card is not good enough. Is the theme song here to block?
