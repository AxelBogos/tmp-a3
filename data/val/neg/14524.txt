I was shocked as soon as I opened it. This is a Hong Kong drama, with kimchi mixed in. The plot is weak, the little girl is too strong, and the big Komatsu moved it casually. Hao er is afraid of butterflies. Did she just know? it takes a long time for the remote control plane to operate like that. Other people's acting skills are only healthy and too good to watch.
