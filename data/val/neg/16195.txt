The level still does not escape the limitations of the anti-Japanese drama, the war is a war of flesh and blood, rather than one side as tall as a dragon and the other as small as a mouse. In this film, the role of Lai Dao lacks the thinking and purpose of real people, and it is entirely a foil for Li Shunchen.
