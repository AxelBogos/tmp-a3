It's not interesting, it's just a story about a madman. Before watching this movie, I thought he was quite pitiful and had a lot of last resort. After reading it, I changed my mind. He was crazy and frightening, regardless of other people's lives. Why do you want to film his legend? I don't think he has that much weight.
