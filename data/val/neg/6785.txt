Married to Dashan woman sci-fi version. The loser unfortunately caught up with the broken machine and woke up 90 years ahead of schedule. In order not to live alone for the rest of his life, he simply awakened a goddess to accompany him. What is the essential difference between this and rape? The goddess was lucky to have Stockholm syndrome and not only forgave but also fell in love with him, WTF! I didn't expect that there will be such a broken movie in the late 1910's!
