If in a ghost movie, there is a poop-stirring stick who has no quality to rummage through things in other people's homes, basically this show is a bad movie. Come back, Arvin! It's really not good for the soul-summoning universe to go on like this. I can't believe you laughed at me at night! It's a big haunted house Reality Show show!
