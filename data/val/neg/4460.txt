This movie is in the popularity of the Jubilee Strategy, isn't it? The film is so bad, can the screenwriter get a snack? The fucking mindless plot, the mentally handicapped, the BUG are numerous! Bah! Bah! Can the director watch Infernal Affairs and Blood Shuangxiong and then make this movie? don't watch Ip Man and think you can really beat ten of them!
