Although the screenwriter does everything to beautify the troubles of adoption, this movie still makes me feel like a nameless fire. 🖕🏼 seriously, don't have a baby if you can't take care of the baby, okay? If you don't have the patience to adopt a baby, don't adopt, okay? Can no offspring die? Sure enough, reproductive cancer is rife all over the world, no matter whether it is developed or not, so your country's problem is more urgent, so you hurry to make a policy. The United States first made a movie to create momentum 🙃. Seriously, even after watching this one, I didn't realize the good thing about having children at all. It's really annoying to make so many shit in your running-in, okay?

After thinking about it, it was changed from two stars to one star, 🙃.
