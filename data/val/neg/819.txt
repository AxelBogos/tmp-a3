It was a terrible movie, and I began to suspect that the leading actors of this film had something in the hands of Huang Baiming to take over such a play. The situation is twisted, the character is far-fetched, the setting is painful, the event is false, the joke is overnight, and the emotion is stiff. The tragedy is that it is a comedy. Comedy can be exaggerated and abnormal, but it must have its own logic.
