It took a long time to finish the film.
The advantage of this play is that the heroine is beautiful.
The disadvantage is that the plot is boring.
In fact, I am a little baffled. Didn't the man say at first that he just wanted to be friends? As a result, the hostess refused (? After his confession, he angrily burned the diary, and did the hostess mean that friends should stop doing it? Because there was no amnesia at that time, but did not find the main male to exchange diaries. Later, in the finale, the woman mainly made friends with the male host, and he gladly agreed. ) Excuse me? In short, it's all kinds of mess.
