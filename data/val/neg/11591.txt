I have to say that this is a particularly boastful film, lack of enough adventure elements, magic skills rise and fall according to the situation, all kinds of contradictions and obstacles are like children playing every house, and the stage dialogue appears deliberately and pretentious. The protagonist is more like a professional wizard than his uncle, but the awkward villain comes on stage too late and his skills are too weak. The trace of magic for the sake of magic is too heavy, regardless of the collapse of stories and people.
