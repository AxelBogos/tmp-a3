It is a shame to admit that you are smiling, because the joke is based on the harm done to others. A little talent is presumptuous, saving some people but injuring more; the battlefield is like a bar, soldiers dress like Johns; war is pure indulgence, humor eventually becomes an insult. You have to master the yardstick when you joke. You libertarians are really annoying in the face of death.
