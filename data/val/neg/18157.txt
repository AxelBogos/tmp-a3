Although a lot of handheld and close-up shots are used, and editing is very painstaking, it still can't cover up the thinness of the script. In fact, this movie makes me feel that it doesn't matter whether I shoot it or not, and it might be more important to make a documentary. Portman was good, but he was blind.
