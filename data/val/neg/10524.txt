Huo Yuanjia has such a black history! Jet Li really looks old, but his voice is very tender; the theme is too much. How martial and inspirational with Chinese characteristics; is it because other people's mandarin is so poor? Young actors are bad; Sun Li's role is very pretentious but cute; Nong Jinsun really devoted his life; a very bad and easy-to-guess film; people feel old as they get old; anyway, they are very stupid.
