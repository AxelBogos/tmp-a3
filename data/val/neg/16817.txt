Relatively general, known as comedy, but did not smile after watching the film, too simple and straightforward, you can know the end at the beginning. It is as if a teacher told a tedious joke on the podium, and the students below smiled symbolically. This film is telling the audience that what I want to express is a pure and noble theme. Please be moved. But the process is disappointing.
