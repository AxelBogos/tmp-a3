The relationship between the characters is so complicated that they don't know the factions until they have read half of it, and the plot jumps so fast that they are running out of patience. The love action scene is so sudden. The scene of the fight is still good. The acting skill of Lee Min-ho in this book is much better than that of city hunting. the key is that he has a good figure and a good rack, and the action picture is better.
