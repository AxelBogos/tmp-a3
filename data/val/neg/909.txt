Unexpectedly, the film directed by Gueridge has completely lost the cool and cool momentum of the past. I watched it slowly for an hour. Alicia is very exquisite, but the acting is absent-minded, like a girl in fashion, without temperament. The Superman-like color is very handsome, but without the appearance of the leading actor, it is even more difficult to distinguish who is master and who is second because of the similarity of male and male faces. Disappointed.
