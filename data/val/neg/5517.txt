2.5 / premiere, how to say, although it is a comedy, but all kinds of jokes are the bad stalks of Jackie Chan and Zhou Xingchi, but this is already the highlight of this film. The story is thin; all the characters are too symbolic, and the hostess runs all night in high heels! The use of music is a disaster, Turandot, knife and so on. In fact, I feel that the director still has some ideas, but the effect of the implementation is not satisfactory, continue to work hard!
