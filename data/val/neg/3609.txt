The director seems to be obsessed with the line, bullshit jokes, and thinking is also very leaping, too much do not know the so-called confession, do not know what he wants to say. The only thing I can see is Xue Kaiqi's face, which was also a piece of fresh meat at that time. Not to mention the new sister, it has nothing to do with the first two films, it's too ugly.
