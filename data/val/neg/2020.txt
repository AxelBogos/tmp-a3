Who can tell me how this bad film has 8 years, who is talking about the female version of those years, who said that the domestic youth film has been poor for many years! Where did such an artificial and pretentious film meet the earth? It is completely a hard pile of all kinds of youth elements, with no soul at all. The best actress in the Golden Horse Award with this film? It's a pig, right? No, I have to watch those years again!
