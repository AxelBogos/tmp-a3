The same R21 is a far cry from the Wolf of Wall Street. The beginning of the film says truth entertainment, I was thinking that the audience may not want to know truth, the message that the film wants to express is the most important. "Hua" also deliberately ignores the suicidal plot of the loser, keeping the plot excited.
