After reading the first half, I thought it was a conscription promotional film, and after watching the second half, I found that the basic nature was a missionary image.
As awkward as Brave Heart, these two films are like directors' forced selection in order to realize their desire to shoot bloody violence, full of conceited, vulgar and narrow worldviews.
Why do people who are keen on bloody violence still engage in humanistic care and the brilliance of human nature? Is it hypocritical? Can we honestly learn the structure and form of the film? is there a way out? does it have to be a theme mixed with an Oscar? is it very fulfilling?
Let's just shoot a story about a pair of black lesbians who bravely killed the Nazis in World War II.

As a war film, humanistic care floats on the surface, relying on bloody props to respond to the side of the war. All the plots are accompanied by routines and logical problems, the characters face the special effects, and pay homage to our country's anti-Japanese drama many times.
It is not easy to be unassailable in all directions.

One star gives Hugo Weiwen and the real interview at the end of the film.
