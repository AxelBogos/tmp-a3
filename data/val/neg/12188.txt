In the end, the finished product is the same as I expected after watching the trailer, the plot is not much, but into a menu-style monster Daquan, the soul version of the museum wonderful night, almost all the scenes are the main characters take turns to be strangely frightened. Wen Ziren only worked as an executive producer with both hands after filming "Soul 2", but the problem is that the successors only scratched the surface and did not understand the core. The most important thing is the story. Don't just focus on designing the shape and origin of monsters. You can't do it without a story.
