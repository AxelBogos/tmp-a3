The deal is probably to see all kinds of metaphors in the whole process. My Japanese male friend and I, who didn't see any metaphor, said that the plot was too simple and old-fashioned for the whole children's film. In other words, the painting style is very characteristic and praiseworthy. It is also unfortunate for the director to have an audience who does not understand political history and barely passes, which leads to complete get without innuendo and metaphor.
