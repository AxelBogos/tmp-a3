The latest 13 blockbusters, since the number of literary films, why spend so much money to enter the commercial cinema to test the perseverance of the audience? At the beginning of the black-and-white effect, I thought that the black-and-white film did not last long, not to mention the accent, a few words in the spoken language would be a dialogue in classical Chinese. It is better to make a silent film than to act as soon as you open your mouth. The plot is so simple that it takes only three minutes to add bath water, not to mention the landscape photos. I feel that the actors are embarrassed when they finish the dialogue.
