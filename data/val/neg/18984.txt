Watching Hashimoto bear to talk about writing a screenplay, the most important thing is to set the theme and depict the characters in the early stage, and then how to write the script, the general direction will not be biased. The most important problem of "the unknown" is that it does not pay attention to portraying the characters in the early stage, and all the emphasis is on creating conflicts, which leads to the current film, almost everyone is flat, which also leads to the logic of the character's behavior and the logic of the development of the story, which is difficult to stand up to scrutiny. In addition, the ability of the director is too poor, the audio-visual language is almost useless, and the emotional creation depends entirely on the soundtrack. Even if I love the "blind man" of 13, I still think it is too bad. Can understand why the fire, black absurdity, multi-line narrative, dialect swearing, these are no problem, the problem is that there are no characters who can support these.
