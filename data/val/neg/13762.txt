There is no way to like the little yellow man. Why don't you make progress and improve the plot quality? It is not cute to be able to make the plot so perfunctory, the story of stealing diamonds and fighting bad guys is blunt with the addition of maternal love, unicorns, prison, wind and clouds, and other useless branch lines. The chestnuts of the Ice Age can at least push the story to the small yellow man. What is the impact after the passage is deleted? it's all nonsense! Only BGM still has a high quality plus one star since three episodes.
