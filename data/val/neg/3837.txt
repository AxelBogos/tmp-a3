I can't believe it took me time to finish watching this movie. I haven't played a star for a long time. I think the plot of this play is rotten. Gu Dezhao's level has been dragged down by the mainland's cooperation system. In fact, Gu Dezhao has only directed two good films, "Happy Birthday" and "Zero spies inside". Nothing else can be seen. I came to see Lin's clear purpose.
There is nothing to sell except for a few jokes in the plot.
