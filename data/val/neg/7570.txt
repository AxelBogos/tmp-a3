Maybe it's because I've become a boring adult that I can't look down on such fairy tales at all. I always think of the very realistic question: why should you eat other people's hard-growing vegetables for free? if I do have rabbits like that, I will feel bored and want them all to leave. Anyway, I don't like it.
