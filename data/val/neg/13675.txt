Generally speaking, it is a bad experimental film, and the writing and directing department under the average age of 30 has only ideas left. The themes of expression can be extended, either the madness of people in lonely situations, or the collapse of the reconstruction of civilization. The soundtrack is so excellent that it is almost more uncomfortable than the picture. (has the creative team of Black Mirror seen this? )
