Originally, I went to see it because the theme was good. Unexpectedly, I was extremely disappointed. The transmission of the theme that the director wanted to express could not make all the audience feel the same way. On the contrary, it made people feel that the plot was chaotic and the logic was a little far-fetched. As for the acting skills and lines of the heroine, it was really disappointing as always.
