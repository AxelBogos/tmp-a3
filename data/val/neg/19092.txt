[2 +] the new episode of Die Hard is really crappy. After a lot of the fourth episode, I can't count the strength of the conditions and the bad connections between the characters. The most important explosions and actions are really worth the attack. Is it possible to get a good shot and wait for a long time to do it? The most expensive score was 97 points, and the boss thought that the big meeting packed had one wave after another, and he wanted it because of lack of satisfaction and goodness. (Feb 16 1605 AMC PP)
