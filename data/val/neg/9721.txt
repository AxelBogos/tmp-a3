The reason why I complain about the families who watch thunder dramas is that I always follow to see such speechless dramas. How uncomfortable it is that you can't find a location at all, or even a stem who wants to think about it. An adventure story is told upside down, and a strange and chaotic plot is added, thanks to the fact that you are not responsible for the online drama. How cold it would be to go to the snow plains without even taking a cotton-padded jacket when you low to most people with one suit of clothes. It's like the echo of a completely senseless beginning and end. The whole film may be the self-delight of the director, screenwriter and actors. The only thing I can see is CG. I don't know why such a thunder drama CG is actually quite good. At least the scene in the snow field is not bad, and the scene is quite lifelike. The whole scene of the undersea tomb is commendable, except that Po-se is a little too much. Generally speaking, the artist of your crew should be a great god.
