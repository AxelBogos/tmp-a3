The whole film is calm and boring. Takeshi Kitano's performance can be said to be non-performing, dull and even mind-wandering. Talking about moral matters, the bosses did not hesitate to sacrifice relatives and subordinates for their interests, and Takeshi Kitano became the last guardian of Renyi Road, an almost boring film.
