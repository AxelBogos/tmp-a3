For the king, if the beginning of love is to beat your heart with joy, you can't help but get close to him, think of him, and be by his side, no matter how you end up. So deeply in love will better understand each other's happiness, understand his thoughts, even if it will make their own heartache, but also willing to put on a cassock for him and send him westward.
