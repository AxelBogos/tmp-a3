The movie has no priority at all. The key things are missing, but the things that spend great efforts to describe are some minor things, and the progress of the story also appears to be very stiff. (the director may want to focus on the other side of Margaret Thatcher, but this attempt is really a failure.) after watching this film, I didn't feel Mrs. Thatcher's powerful aura and courage as a politician at all. let alone her shrewdness and sharpness.
