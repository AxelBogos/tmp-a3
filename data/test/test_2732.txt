This kind of film is bound to have a world-saving hero to turn the tide and save the world at the last second. How exciting the fight scene is will be more attractive, but not so powerful, okay? human beings can do it? Extra points for the cliff section of the snow-capped mountains. I enjoyed watching it very well. The movie is three-star. I will give you an extra star for this part.
