The pace of 130min is relatively slow, many details are more obscure, causes and consequences need to think about their own brains. Many protagonists and lines are scattered, although there is intersection, but it always seems to take a long time to produce another protagonist. At first I thought Huo Jianhua played a traitor and finally met Zhou Xun, who grew up as an enemy. The soundtrack has a lot of feeling (always feel that Brother Xun doesn't have any feeling? )
