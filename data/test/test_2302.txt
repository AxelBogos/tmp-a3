The feeling after reading is that a group of ignorant and so-called brave people dare to go anywhere. Norchebele's theme is very good, and it is spoiled by a bunch of radiation zombies alive, but the plot reasoning is all right, full of screams and horror sound effects, not frightened by the movie, but XXOO your ears by the sound effects.
