The movie of Journey to the West to conquer demons is still very wonderful. Although it is a bit bloody at the beginning, the overall rhythm is still very good. The article plays Tang Xuanzang, who is a bit in the second grade, which is still very funny, but what amazes me most is Huang Bo. I was really surprised when I danced. I didn't expect to dance so well.
