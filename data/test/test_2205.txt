After several days of entanglement, I saw countless people in Amway's circle of friends and finally went to see "Gang Rinpozi" alone, fearing that his film was too good and beautified the matter, and that he was afraid that his film was too bad and pure consumer belief. Fortunately, it still looks smooth and steady, and I can feel that this is a period of spiritual practice by the director. The scenery along the way reminds me of the situation when I hitchhiked into Tibet a few years ago, and I miss it very much.
