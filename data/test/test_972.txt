There are too many hidden tricks in the film. It is not easy for ordinary people to understand all feelings. For Spielberg. It is not a good work. Spielberg used to be characterized by his ability to describe stories that are easy to understand. But Dazu made a move. Douban, many people kneel regardless of whether they know the film or not. Is it really worth 8.2 points?
