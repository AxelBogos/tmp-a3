It should be the purest and strongest Hong Kong flavor movie I have ever seen this year. Qiu Litao can be said to be one of the directors who can make B-rated films best. The film takes the life of an ordinary Hong Kong citizen as an incision, aiming at the survival plight of Hong Kong society at present. It makes people laugh, at the same time, it makes people laugh and cry.
