I decided not to watch horror films without Wen Ziren's participation in the future. Nima has no latent 3 trailers throughout the film that are scary. The process imitates the copycat style, the roles are so rigid that they have to kneel, and the young actors are still unlikable. You know what's more annoying than a garrulous little girl in a horror movie? That is, there is a garrulous little boy in his family! All kinds of things came to a dead end, and I almost threw popcorn all over the screen.
