It really doesn't look good. I don't know why it's so hot. The music is ordinary, the story is general, and the overall atmosphere is not right. Maybe it is indeed the young age of the audience. Personal feeling is not as good as the Lion King, not as good as Robot Mobilization, not as good as a thousand and thousand fathom.
