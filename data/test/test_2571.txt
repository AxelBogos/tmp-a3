The poster and length of the movie are my favorite, plus the band in the name must have good music, download decisively. It looks really sleepy. At the beginning of the eight people standing at the airport to take photos of the embarrassment and stillness, black humor is a bit of a cowboy beauty. In the quiet and closed Israeli desert town, several people made waves because of the band's visit, with a terrible slow pace and frequent embarrassment. The melodious Arabic songs under the night sky in the desert are so beautiful.
