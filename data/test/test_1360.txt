The ancestor is the object of reference from the back. In 1973, in addition to the slightly stiff lines, there were plenty of scary scenes. The section of the staircase and the 180-degree head and the flash picture should not be too scary. These are all the things that you will be afraid of when you feel horrible at the moment. I have a long way to go in the scope of broaden horror movies.
