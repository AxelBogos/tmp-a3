The director seemed to know nothing but indiscriminate bombardment and efforts to stir up emotion, which made his ears uncomfortable, and the effect of watching movies in the cinema was really not good. The theme beat has to be a little level, the theme is good, but it is a pity that it has been spoiled. Less than half of "go ahead".
