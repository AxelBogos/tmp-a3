With beads like Liu Yaren in front, Bao Bell is too much of a show. I can see his efforts, BUT hillbilly styling plus bulk English, which is not a bit of a dude look, it is better to let wuli Tao Tao or Canadian electric eel to play a natural role. As a remake, basically copied the key stalks of the original film, so there is no surprise to speak of, can only be said to be "loyal to the original."
