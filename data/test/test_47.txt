The most stupid Spider-Man movie in history, even worse than two extraordinary songs, and the extraordinary two are already mediocre and boring to me. Please do not add spider-man elements to the youth road comedy romance, thank you. Delete all the Spider-Man-related plots and I will give four Stars. The truth is that no one cares about the post-Iron Man era. After the final battle, it seems that Marvel Spider-Man and that piece of shit-like special effects garbage have been degraded. If "Hero returns" I still think that the daily plot of the campus may be too bloated, then this film is completely reversed. Did I tell you that I fast-forward all the plots of the Nick Fry line and skip all the special effects scenes except Tower Bridge of London? Who wants to see this kind of pure green screen CG special effects after 2019, and then you have to emphasize that all the special effects I see are fake and are all made by human technology. Thank you. Wow, you can also play suspense and multiple reversals with me, but the whole plot is based on coincidence. Nick Fry didn't come back after five years of ash? Oh, this is also a fake, where are you filming your mother?
