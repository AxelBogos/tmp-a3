The whole film is full of horror and tension. At the same time, there are a series of behavioral logic problems, although it is to advance the plot, but there is always something wrong, such as Billie why not wait until dawn when she is safe at first? Two big men killed a silent girl and were killed back without anything? Such as this is not to blame, as a whole is already a very excellent work. The absence of words affects the moviegoer's mood even more.
