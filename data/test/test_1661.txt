Before Hu Jinquan, there was no inn play, and after Hu Jinquan, there was no more inn play. And the storm in Yingchun Pavilion is the pinnacle of the inn play. The scheduling of Hu Jinquan's small space scene is unique. The opening of an inn scene with a mixture of dragons and snakes is even more remarkable. This film even has a very good comedy effect. The villain's IQ and force are all very high, which shows the hardship and will of the protagonists. Although Xu Feng has few lines, this character is really alive!
