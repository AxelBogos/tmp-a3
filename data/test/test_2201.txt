Four and a half stars, regret not going to the cinema. To say the deficiency: it is really not necessary for this film to use the form of pseudo-documentary. Compared with the 1996 Tornado, the special effects have risen to more than one level, but the overall shock is not as strong as the old ones, the emotional portrayal of the characters is too fast food, and the soundtrack is more mediocre. Ps doesn't have any good disaster movies this year, and it's rare to have one that can enjoy your eyes. That's enough for the two three stars.
