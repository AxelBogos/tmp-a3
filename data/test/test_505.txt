I originally wanted to see something relaxed, but I was embarrassed to have cancer. I couldn't find a joke. Many jokes were a little dirty, and women were objectified in them. I guess the significance of this film to me is just to help me to peep into the psychology of people at that time. I don't like this film, but what I am interested in is why it was so popular at that time that it even became a memory of a generation.
