K lost her original femininity after coming out of the closet, and watching her acting with an actor is simply watching two men who don't love each other at all. Whether it's same-sex CP or heterosexual CP, a good combination can make the audience feel the hormones of both sides across the screen, but K flirting with Jesse and Steve is really weird, like a little les who gives up himself and reluctantly follows straight men in order to make a living, while K's aggressive attitude makes straight men look like a particularly loser.
