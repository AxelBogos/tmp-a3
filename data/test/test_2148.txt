I can't believe Ang Lee shot this kind of rubbish. The actors were embarrassed to read their lines in awkward Putonghua, and it was extremely awkward to arrange straightforward conversations between Westerners on ancient Chinese people. The script is quite bad, the plot turns inexplicably, and every word does not agree with each other. This film is crazily piled up symbols for the sake of the West's curiosity about the East. It is estimated that only hillbilly Americans will like this kind of blind visual fast food (after all, they also like heroes).
