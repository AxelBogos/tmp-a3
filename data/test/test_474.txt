Dragon Ball... Or how to keep milking a franchise that should have been dead ages ago. In a shameless attempt to keep the saga alive, a few corporates pretty much forced Akira Toriyama to put his name on the credits (even though he did not participate in the project) and looked for whatever has been popular in DB history. Ludicrous result... The original OVA with Broly was IMO the best one ever released in Dragon Ball's story, but everything that made it stunning is absent on the remake.
