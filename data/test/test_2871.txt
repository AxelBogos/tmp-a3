The first few shots really startled me, but then I got used to it, and why didn't I have that feeling of fear? no, no, no. I thought the film was rather dull, but the little boy acted really well, especially when he finally talked about grandma. The ending is unexpected, in order not to let the students who are about to watch are as cheap as me and see a small part of the ending, I will not say, go and see, it is really beautiful!
