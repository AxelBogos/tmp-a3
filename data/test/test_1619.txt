It was a good half. "Lobster Criminal Police" the same story, but a lot of fine-tuning, and more reasonable in the main line of the story, the first half is the desperate anti-narcotics police officers under the fried chicken shop as a monitoring base, this part with high saturation settings to strengthen the protagonists' career crisis (the wife is angry, the daughter entered the door but called herself a monitor), the contrast of unexpected success in making fried chicken plus the details of the design is quite unexpected. The middle part begins to get tired, first, the protagonists' entanglements are given too much, and second, the whole handling of drug cartels is too farce, which makes the second half of the action design lose its foundation (because it is a farce atmosphere, how can the audience follow the tension? Although in the design, it is emphasized that these criminals are also warm-blooded people (there is no internal anti-narcotics unit and major crime unit fighting each other), but this design is too stiff to dilute the farce behind, and the so-called Thai boxing skills of female police officers are too fake. Comedy still needs intelligence and seriousness, you are smarter than the audience, you can complain about sharp arrangement and surprise, you do things seriously, you can arouse the audience's mood outside the comedy, you can't giggle to the end, can you?
