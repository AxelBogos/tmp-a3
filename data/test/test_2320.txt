The charm of history lies in its agnosticity and drama. From the standpoint at that time, the fair and affluent communist regime of Korea was definitely more attractive than the corrupt Li Seung-Man regime, and history made a big joke. Those who boast of vanishing their masters become imperial despotism, and those reactionary puppets are transformed into democratic and modern times. And those who use what is now known to deny the original unknown, they feel guilty. You and I are both people in the network, who is better than who?
