I've written a lot, but it's not enough, so keep it simple. Huang Zhenzhen is used to take DV shooting as the starting point, warm cushion, and then plain leads to tragedy, sadness aggravates, pushing to the best part, time dilutes tragedy, and finally comes a muddle-headed ending, followed by a list of actors. "break up and love you again" is basically the same route. Huang Zhenzhen's technique is very original, amnesia, but the content is true, and the failure of the operation is a foreshadowing. There is still a lot of limited space.
