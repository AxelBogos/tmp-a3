The magic movie needs to be watched again and again, and I still remember the shock when I saw it for the first time. Simple single scene, completely driven by dialogue, no mass production, no high-tech, no hot action [science fiction], completely from the form of mind-blowing. As for the content, as long as we have some knowledge of human history, we will naturally be attracted by it.
