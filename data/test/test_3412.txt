Do not talk about Ang Lee's personal feelings, simply measured by the film narrative. This story is not very wonderful, of course, there is a very deep perspective on the subject matter. Two embarrassed and confused men, do not know why to fight, guard the tradition, and the tradition has disappeared; fight for the south, themselves are different; fight for the heart, but the heart has been desolated. In the end, Holt left, a little sad, can't they live together? Is it against the meaning of freedom to be together?
