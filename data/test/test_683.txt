The whole film is too boring, I have to say that it is good to distinguish between real and virtual ideas with picture quality, but the picture quality used to distinguish reality is very uncomfortable. The expressionless Osui style seems to be ingenious to use in animation, but it doesn't seem to be very good to shoot real people. It can only be said that this film is an experiment by Ai Shou. Compared to raiding girls, this is pretty good.
