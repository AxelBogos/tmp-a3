It has been very depressing for more than two hours, but there is no way to release the emotion-just like the children inside, from the dark to the dawn of the airport, there is no tear in the farewell of life and death. (of course, the lyrics of that song are too cruel) No one knows, almost no one knows their existence, and the most ordinary life that belongs to everyone is a treasure they dare not expect. The details are so beautiful, it's Yuki and really. Ugh.
