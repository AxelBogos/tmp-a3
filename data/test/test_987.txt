Low-budget production, actors and crew are mostly Kevin Smith's friends and relatives, "Clerks" is a great movie, with an insipid perspective to look at the mundane life! Smith's real talent comes from the interesting lines in the film. People may either like Smith movies or hate them! If you don't hate vulgar humor and treat porn as jokes like noble art, you may enjoy the film. His unique humor is not for everyone, but this is by far the best Smith film. (film reviews!)
