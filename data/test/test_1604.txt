1. It's actually a martial arts movie 2. Wang Xueqi is an old actor, where the soul of the whole film lies. The end of the film says "the Revolution of 1911 succeeded"? This history is sports. Did Uncle Wang at the gate teach you that? 4. Why do I always think it was directed by Peter Chan, and I wonder how Chen Kexin made such a bad thing?
