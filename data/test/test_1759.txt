[7.5]
[cinema] the special effects are good, but there are too many emotions in the script and story, not enough resonance, and there are some awkward pictures and lines.
In the later part of the whole movie, I just saw the raging fire, put out the fire, only danger, surprise is not enough. Life escape play, a little messy, the theme is not clear enough, still not enough to infect the audience. Summarize the advantages and disadvantages, but also more obvious, is a film between 7-8 points.
