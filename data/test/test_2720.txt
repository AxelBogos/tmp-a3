The intention is still quite profound, but the twists and turns look for evidence and overturn the evidence, implying cult abuse in the clouds, but the final outcome lies in the stress and protective response taken by people after psychological cues. The rhythm of the film is messy, the narrative is moving, and the reversal is powerless. The viewer is like eating a decent dish, that is, he will burp and choke, and he will never be able to dispel his negative emotions after eating.
