Italy's resistance movement, six stories are very good, Rosellini mixed documentary and feature film techniques, the use of non-professional actors (more real), making his images complex and real, incomparably moving. I like the three stories of girls and soldiers, soldiers and children, and priests very much. Rosselini's trilogy is getting better and better (developing neo-realism).
