Damn it, can you not go to Peng Yuyan's chest? The plot is really good, although it doesn't seem to be Huang Feihong, but who knows, brotherly love is a little touching, Jing Beran's acting skills are beyond my imagination, needless to say stunts, Peng Yuyan's dubbing is still a little bit, and his lines are a little weak. One star to Peng Yuyan, handsome, one star to Sammo Hung, so fat can still fight, one star to Jing Beran, uh-huh.
