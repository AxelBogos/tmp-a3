I have always loved Greek mythology so I am particularly picky about adaptation. I hardly see any satisfactory works, but I have an inexplicable preference for this edition. Although Hercules, who is troubled by youth, looks like an unsociable high school student, he does not deceive himself and others to avoid the identity of the son of God, does not pretend to think deeply about the nothingness of heroes, and happily runs all the way to become heroes, defeating monsters, protecting people and saving beauties. This is Greek mythology! Minus one star at the end.
