Boring, pretentious country romance! Jia Zhangke has been repeating himself, deeply obsessed with pop songs, song and dance halls, street performances, coal mines, stations, squares and small potatoes at the bottom. Really can not appreciate the director Jia, each play is extremely boring, repeated use of the elements also make people aesthetic fatigue. Even less appreciative of his wife, neither good-looking nor acting, how awkward it is, it's a big cut in the movie.
