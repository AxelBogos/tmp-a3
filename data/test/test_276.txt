Ding Sheng is very good at controlling crime themes and small patterns and small spaces. This time, the realistic and black humor style comes from the texture of real cases. The story is simple and powerful, and the rhythm and editing are very good. Wang Qianyuan's acting skills are too magical. Liu Dehua is a little too tall, Liu Ye looks like a black migrant worker. The emotion at the end is strong, and the sentence "my life is better than you" is ironic and playful compared with reality. Wu Ruofu's participation in this film has mixed feelings.
