The back music arranged by Director Jia made me throw myself to the ground again, which was directly too loving. After Xiao Tao scolded her boyfriend for not being a thing, the Ode to Joy sounded merrily. When Xiao Tao's boyfriend dated a xx dresser for the first time, the back music naturally jumped out of "ask if you dare", and Sister Liu's song changed from a simple transformation to the seduction of red fruit. The application of animation makes me love Director Jia even more.
