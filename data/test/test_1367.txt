I thought I was going to find the child, but after watching it, I found that the biggest suspense of the film is not "where is the Child", but "who is she?" in the end, it is a film that reflects on men and the care of their original families. Yao Chen played well, Ma Yili was impressive, the play was relatively steady, and it was a pity that the ending lacked a cathartic outlet.
