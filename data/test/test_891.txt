If you really talk about the sequels in Hong Kong films, there are really very few classics, and this film is one. As a reference to the sequel of Infernal Affairs, there is more cross-development of the two dimensions, while Lailuo 2 is followed by the previous narrative, which itself has a certain degree of difficulty, and without the characters, the plot is more concentrated and the tension is stronger. Each character is still outstanding, emotional aspects can also be in place, a lot of places so far. That's great!
