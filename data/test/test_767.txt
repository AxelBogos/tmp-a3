When I read the poster, I always thought it was a literary film, but it turned out to be a fairy tale love comedy, but the score was very low. I thought the lady with pig nose was more attractive. There are too few parts in the play, and it's a little incomprehensible to fall in love so easily. We can only say that a movie is a movie. Listen to the BGM at the end of the film!
