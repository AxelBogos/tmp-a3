Paid to watch on iqiyi, the scenery is very beautiful, although the plot is a little chicken soup, but also moderate, but do not feel annoying, especially the tidbits after the end of the film, they really shot on the spot, I think this is very important, originally Samsung, but to see them shoot so hard, or add two stars, regret not going to the cinema at that time
