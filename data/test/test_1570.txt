Telling the story of women who have been insulted and persecuted is supposed to be a story with strong emotions. But the view is the Japanese-style scenery of distant mountains such as Dai and ancient temples. At the end of the story, the cloud is light and the wind is light, and the meaning is still unfinished. It is the unique beauty of sorrow and seclusion of the Japanese. Whenever you are not afraid to guess the character's behavior with the worst malice, they always touch the softest place in your heart with the kindest choice and make you burst into tears.
