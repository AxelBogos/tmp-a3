The action scene is great, boxing to flesh, the sense of visual impact is very strong, and there is not much nonsense that has been played all the time. Muay Thai, taekwondo and Brazilian war dance are very enjoyable to watch, as well as that long shot. I'd like to know how to shoot it so that my hair stands up.
