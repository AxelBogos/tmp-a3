The scene and instantaneous memories of your life, you are dead, regardless of the past, regardless of the future, even if covered with blood, even if you win love, even if you are full of memories, you have to let go of what should be put down, and what should be abandoned should be abandoned. Life does not bring death and does not take away, all of the film is just Simon's light and shadow before his death played back his life and his reluctance, the last two projections of the world, Simon's life game to the end.
