I hate this kind of movie very much. At the end of the movie, the old man with hearing loss gave a demonstration to all of us men! That is when your wife is dealing with you, please turn off your hearing aid! If your hearing is normal, please turn off the auditory nerve in your brain with your mind! Instead of quarreling and quarrelling madly, it is better to hold yourself crazy and save effort!
