"neighbor" is a bit of an inextricable fetter. Not only people and people, people and ghosts, but also people always live side by side with the malicious / good thoughts between thoughts. The film has a good idea, and several actors also perform well, but the narrative is disorganized and has no focus and no main line, whether it is terror or tenderness or suspense.
