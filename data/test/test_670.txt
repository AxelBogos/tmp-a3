Shanghai is so beautiful. I watched this movie several times at that time, and then I began to feel vaguely predestined to have a long-distance relationship with Shanghai and Tianjin, which ended more than three months ago. Maybe we just don't like the beginning of the episode. Driving through the trees at dusk is so artistic. Right, remember the bowling ball on both sides.
