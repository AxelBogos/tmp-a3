Recently, when I fell in love with Luo Yunxi, I accidentally saw the clip of "meeting you at the most beautiful time" in the headlines. The cautious and uncontrollable love of the first love was well performed by the two protagonists. I seemed to see my first love. Luo Yunxi's nervous breath seemed to be there when he wanted to kiss Fangfang. I read and commented that many people said that dog blood, work, very strange where they see dog blood, but I think it's too real. It seems that the story that has happened or is happening to me and many friends around me is very true. Luo Yunxi is very good. His acting skill is much better than those so-called big-name fresh flesh. I hope to see more of his works.
