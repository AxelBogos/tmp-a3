There are many religious references under the cloak of science fiction: 1: the resurrection of the dead (1 Corinthians is quoted in "carving time") 2: the man's brainwaves are thrown into the sea of Solaris, where islands appear. (Genesis) the resurrected wife returns to human nature as a non-human being, and the space station is the place where human nature is tested. Tashi: the mission of art is to find God in human nature. The isolated island in the sea seems to be the predecessor of the small and medium-sized wooden cabin of "homesickness".
