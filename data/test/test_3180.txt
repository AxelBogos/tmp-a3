A 39-year-old director asked questions to life in the tone of an 80-year-old man. If you think about it this way, it may make it easier for the audience to get started. If we compare the exquisite theme and seemingly heavy theme with the philosophical trend of thought in Europe in the early 20th century, the speculative trend of contemporary European art and Bergman's lack of fatherly love in childhood, Wild Strawberry will become a work that no longer exists in isolation, but the product of the interaction between the director and the times.
