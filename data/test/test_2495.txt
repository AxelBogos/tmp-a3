The story of four people, the face is very beautiful, the costume is very fun, especially the last scene of the match, very interesting! Men are all cowards, but women can't love each other. It's a little bit like having a wife. I really like the marriage of the French, but I really don't. By the way, my favorite scene is outside the window of Buchessa's house. I would be very happy if I lived there.
