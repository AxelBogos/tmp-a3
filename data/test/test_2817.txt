Take it out last night. I don't know why I suddenly want to read it seriously. A warm feeling. I remember that I used to spend the holiday with my sister at my grandmother's house, watching the beautiful woman ghost Altman and Zhou Xingchi in the neighbor mahjong room. That kind of time, that kind of idle mood. I can't speak now.
