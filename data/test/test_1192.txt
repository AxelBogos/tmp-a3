Bad script with no end, Chun Pei Hua walked all the way to the black. Since "Gone Girl", he has frequently played the role of Avengers. This film with details and no paragraphs has Low a lot. The female master's many emotions and cleanliness habits are well described in small details. Chun Pei Hua has excellent acting skills, tiny neuroticism and precision. It is that the ending is too hasty, and the foreshadowing and foreshadowing of foreplay all become cannon fodder, leading to loose deconstruction and the best part of premature ejaculation.
