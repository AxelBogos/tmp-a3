Recently, when I was preparing poetry class, I met this for my bedtime pastime! The four stars are mainly for the good fortune of getting what you want. Chinese films with good words are rare, and there are basically no good works. Fang Daxiao's first film is still a long way off, but this attempt still surprises me. I can't help but look forward to following the singing arena. The film industry can also usher in a Renaissance of Chinese interest. I hope that this brick can really lead to the jade of the classics.
