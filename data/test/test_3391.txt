It is not a Hisha Kirk documentary. It is also a rift in the old age of my parents-in-law. Tostoy's "The Last Station" is much better, and his wife is still Helen Mirren. Hitchcock is portrayed as a mentally handicapped person with a high desire for control and attention, and his companion deliberately creates a sense of creepy, while his wife pursues a self-image, and the victim's sense of rift is heavy. The whole is like a television movie. ★★☆
