This film perfectly interprets what is meant by "ugly cute" and "stupid cute". Ironically, at last year's DreamWorks internal screening, due to poor response, the film was switched to Penguin, but Penguin Street this film was an unexpected hit; if the film had been a big seller, DreamWorks would not have cut so many people to cut so many pieces.
