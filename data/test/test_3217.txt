Bellatar's lighting, composition and long mirror scheduling are amazing. The long mirror that follows the character appears from time to time, but it is different from time to time. The light and shadow of the container car driving from the left to the right side of the background, the silhouette of walking alone at night and the slow pulling lens. The simulated solar eclipse in the pub, the dance in Radsky's march, the children's gongs and drums are crazy. The naked old man in the hospital finally softened the tyranny of the thugs. The fog engulfed the whale. (9.0 take 10)
