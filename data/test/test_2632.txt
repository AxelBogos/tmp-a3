Isn't it a play that I watch with those who kneel and lick for high marks? The front was already rotten to death, and then he came up and commented that the back tidbits were good-looking and hilarious. All right, I put up with it, but it wasn't funny at all. Even if it was a little humorous, it was bad enough for people to roll their eyes.
