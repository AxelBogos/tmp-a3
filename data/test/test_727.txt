In 2005, I spent my holiday in Tieba chasing fan novels against the tide. This is a film where I really fell in love with Zhong Hanliang, and Gu Mei came from then on. Zhang Zhilin himself loves, but the role of Qi Shaoshang is not easy to please. Do not support Qi Guping, but always feel that Xiao Gu needs someone to accompany, which has nothing to do with love.
