Don't get involved in the production of the director's job. It's not called a movie when there's a picture. There was no director at all, and even the performance of his lines was blind. Even if you stay at the basic level of narrative, you can't even deal with audio-visual and visual. The character is illogical. The use of symbolic elements is childish and boring. There is no context and no pattern. All right, the final chase and watched images have been added a little bit.
