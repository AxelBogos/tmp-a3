I'm sorry. I don't understand. Although it is a biography, but the protagonist of the film is a persistent pursuit of the truth while slandering teammates, only this point, I do not know the significance of such a character setting, let alone anything else. Of course, it's not about real people. Love Benny, eldest cousin, Aunt Mei and other actors.
