A very bad film, a reasoning film with no sense of satisfaction, because there is no reasoning at all, everything is either obvious or suspicious, photography and editing are some new ideas, but the whole script is fragile, so we can't delve into any shot, because it's easy to think too much, in fact, it's a very simple story of a scum man cheating on his wife.
