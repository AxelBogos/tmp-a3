Tang people paste like this today, not to mention how happy I am, so like the intricate emotional lines and character relationships, how come we don't shoot the legend of Immortal San now? There is no sense of disobedience and harmony in Jingtian changing its name and putting it directly in the foreign biography. Petty Tang screenwriters, the only way to show the complexity of love is the jealousy of female characters. I wish you an early closure.
