One of my favorite works of ou Rong, at the end of the film, the hero looks at the audience staring at the screen, with a flirtatious look in his desperate eyes, his tears, his cries, and her diary, her madness, her death. This work has been challenging the expectations of the audience with this unique style, using the shooting method of the classic suspense film to describe the director's personal experience and interest, and the influence of the symbolic image metaphor environment on the character's state of mind. Characters express the state of conquest and conquest through sexual desire. Each of Ourong's works is showing the whole process of character alienation, which is a combination of contemporary Kafka and Poe!
