When you see the beginning of the Star-Spangled Banner close-up, you should guess the end of this advertising film, pretending to be nervous, which only increases the pessimistic mentality of our people who hate their father and hate the country's surname and beauty. The film is good, but the bad is that the melody is too popular and too positive. Send an army plane diving frog for a pot-bellied man? Go to your middle-aged dream.
