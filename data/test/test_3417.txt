It looks like a golden year.
Pray for the laughter of the past to reappear
Who meets in the rain in Jinguang?
But why suddenly send each other away?
Look at a chuckle with a breeze
Whether love is forever or not
Circling around in a sea of people
Like a dream gone, a piece of duckweed
It looks like a golden year.
Pray for the laughter of the past to reappear
My heart is broken and I still sigh and miss.
Still looking forward to a repeat of the past
A silent whisper and a starry night without shadow
Time flies is bitter and sweet
Blur is your face on that day.
Become indistinguishable.
