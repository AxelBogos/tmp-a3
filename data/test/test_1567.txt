I wonder why the score is so polarized... The painstaking works of fantasy costumes rarely seen for several years, from scripts to lines, from actors' acting skills to props sets are all very good. Why is the score so low and the story complete, comparable to the biography of Shushan many years ago? finally, the cause and effect of the most wonderful part of the death of the snow demon is not clearly stated, and it is better to paint the skin here.
