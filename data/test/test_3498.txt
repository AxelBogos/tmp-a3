The director is filming a delirious hallucination (the fact is also mixed with hallucinations), telling a lesbian story that is neither scary nor emotional, neither ethical nor reasoning. At first, I thought I was filming "hallucination", but I didn't understand it very well after watching it again, and I didn't want to see it again. Unexpectedly, some people watch it several times, "rational" analysis, but also loudly applauded, so the rating of perverted films is not accurate, do not understand just laugh it off, do not!
