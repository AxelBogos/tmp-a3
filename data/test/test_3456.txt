Some directors actually tell "one story" all their lives. For example, Kubrick has been talking about "how people go crazy", while some so-called directors can only talk about one thing, the so-called Red Age. Many Chinese directors are untalented and can only rely on historical themes to support them. And when is there no scar? There is no need to tell the story of the Red Age, and now the Red Age has not receded.
