First of all, I would like to thank Ade and the Dream Theater for choosing me to participate in this screening event!
I am a loyal fan of the MIB series, and I have been looking forward to the news that the fourth film will be released. Although the protagonists are no longer agents J and K, the combination of Raytheon and Vulcan also makes me believe that it must have more flavor!
As a matter of fact, the combination of the two men is as funny as will Smith.
Generally speaking, the film is relatively qualified, the style is the same as the previous work, and the context of the story is relatively simple, relaxed and witty. There are a few paragraphs that will certainly make you sound like shit and then smile!
In short, it is recommended to see it!
