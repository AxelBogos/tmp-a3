After continuing to owe you at the box office last time (mermaid), whether Stephen Chow can play the emotion card this time depends on whether Stephen Chow can produce good quality works to make the audience feel nostalgic as I saw before. Because both Stephen Chow's feelings and monkey feelings have long been overspent! To borrow a line from the trailer: what I owe him (movie ticket) has already been paid off! In this comparison, I found that the demon of the Journey to the West is a matter of conscience!
