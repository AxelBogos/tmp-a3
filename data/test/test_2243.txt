I just like this kind of movie, romantic, leisurely, tangled and smooth, all the elements are in line with a real movie ah ~ I have seen Hou Mai's "four Seasons" script before, and I admire his line skills and witticism. A lot of the pen and ink in the whole film is done by the characters walking on the beach, relying entirely on lines to explain the plot, this kind of film always wins my mind.
