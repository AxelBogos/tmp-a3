I was lucky not to miss this masterpiece, a movie that made me swear secretly from beginning to end. Severely exposed the Chinese-style parents and education, Chinese-style family and social relations. As for metaphors, they are deep, broad and creepy. Douban's plot brief, the goods are not the right version.
