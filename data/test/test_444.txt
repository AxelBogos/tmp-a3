Really stupid movie. Or the dead best friend dragging the old paper will dress up properly in the middle of the night to see the night show. What happened to Jet Li's last must-kill multiple avatar. There is no doubt that it is true that there is a bad film with Aunt Liu. What's the story of the director? Cast is so important.
