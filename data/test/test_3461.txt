Get to Fage's charm point for the first time! It's time to start reissuing Brother movies. 63 years old, the figure is so good (I look at the painter in the film wearing a hit-color shirt to walk on the back, tall, good proportion, chic posture, this is not a 60-year-old man! I am guilty) the movements are clean and beautiful, and the shooting scene is hot! The expression in the close-up is so comfortable that it doesn't give people a sense of emphasis, and it won't make the audience think of "well, you can watch the acting now" at that moment. Hindsight, this kind of comfort, this kind of nature, is acting. I want to see Fage and Hollywood actors play in their own comfortable language.
