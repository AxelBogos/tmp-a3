It can't be said how wonderful the plot is. When I saw cast at the end of the play, I deeply felt that even the most beautiful face would fade one day, and even the brilliant deeds would be forgotten slowly. At that time, who will be around you, and who will hold your hand as unhesitatingly as at that time. And it doesn't matter what you've done in your life. Always feel a sense of regret when you grow old. )
