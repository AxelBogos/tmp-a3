I admit that I am here for nino. Second, apart from nino, I like this story very much. I have always been worried that this story will whitewash militarism. In the end, it tells the fate of small potatoes and highlights the terrible brainwashing of militarism. Compared to those anti-Japanese dramas that are often dedicated, I prefer small potatoes to be forced to take this path in the torrent of history, because different choices of films with different endings are closer to themselves.
