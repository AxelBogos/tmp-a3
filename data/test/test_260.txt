The title of separation is so apt that the whole film shows the ideological separation in Iranian society through a conflict, and what shocked me is that so many characters are so real before who said that 13 women don't take Oscars. Chinese don't go anymore. I don't think it's going to win the Oscars. Just because you have your lies doesn't mean I don't. You have your stubbornness. Coincidentally, I also have your beliefs, and I call it morality.
