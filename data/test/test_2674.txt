Give five stars in one breath, it is so self-willed! The title of the film, the hero of the film, brings the most interesting and surprisingly beautiful story I have seen this year. Woodcutters, mountain villages, folk rituals and other fresh packaging are delicately and sincerely wrapped in: the sunshine growth of a teenager, a nation's awe of nature, and the emotion of natural simplicity. How does comedy reduce the value of affectation to zero while maximizing the laugh? Use some metaphors.
