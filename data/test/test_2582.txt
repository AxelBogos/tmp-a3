Finally, as soon as the inscription was published, it still made people feel deeply. I don't know whether this inscription really exists. People and sheep, in the depths of the mountains, survive and multiply, and water is the source of life. The times are changing and scientific and technological civilization is developing, but some of them are primitive and really moved, which I think need to be recorded and remembered.
