A very beautiful film, first of all, it tells stories in color, and secondly, it can feel a particularly high philosophical realm, especially in the last two shots, where the lens floats directly in the air. What does red mean in it? I don't quite understand. Editing seems to be playing with time and space, from the image to the monitor, is a leap in time and space.
