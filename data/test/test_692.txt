Saw a free August to see the director himself, too straight feel like, so add a star. In this day and age, it is at least tolerated for films like August to go to the cinema for promotion. I think I have to go to the cinema to make up a ticket. I saw the scenes in which the father burst into tears when watching the movie, driving his son home in a rainy night, and had to hold his breath and punch at home when he didn't want to bow his head. I thought of my father for the first time. Summer is over, but summer is the best.
