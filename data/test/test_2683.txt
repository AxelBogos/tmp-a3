The worst thing of the year, it turned out that the adaptation of the true story did save a little bit of the scene, but it was too much to shoot. I watched it for two hours but didn't say anything, and every character had a bad personality. I felt sorry for my sister Kazan to take this kind of film. I am afraid that the imdb score is not the reappearance of the American Dream of the ethnic talent of the bus.
