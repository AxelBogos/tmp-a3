I hate this kind of film, the pattern and background are too big, the story is actually blank and empty, there is no way to fill this empty shelf, want to say too much, in fact, it looks innocuous, the story has a hard wound without the main line. not good. To tell you the truth, several actors are quite good, and the scenery and so on are also quite advanced.
