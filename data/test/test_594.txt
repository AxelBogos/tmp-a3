I like the novel very much, and the movie is a very ordinary love movie. Screenwriters and writers, can not think that both writers are simply the same, the professional level is too poor. Lost the joke and didn't add the theme or main line. Marseilles is very similar to those seen in Singles Day. I thought it was Shopping Day and forgot that it was Singles Day. As a result, I was badly abused by sad.
