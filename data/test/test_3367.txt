Tomorrow's actress what junk translation. The hostess is really too dazzling, I also want to be such a girl, naturally exudes the charm of sunshine. I can understand female 2 and empathize with her, but I don't want to be similar to her. I admit that sometimes I will be extreme and do something I regret, all i can do is to try my best to become a better me.
