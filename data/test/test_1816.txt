Look at the ugly faces of this group of dead Christians persecuting pagans and Jews! You can say that the Bible is right and is only used by people like Cyril, but if this stupid religion is so sacred, how can it be used? Since those who believe in this religion are still bad people, what does it matter whether they believe in it or not? If you look at the people around you, you will feel superior if you believe in a broken Christ. What bullshit! Hypocrisy!
