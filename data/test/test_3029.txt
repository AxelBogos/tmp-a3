Just made a suspense film by using the paradox, the others are useless rubbish, the dialogue is childish and ridiculous, the characters are as thin as paper, and they have been pretending to be deep, and the plot is simple and has a tall name with connotation in the new world. in fact, it's not as good as a game of three Kingdoms. It's awkward to death.
