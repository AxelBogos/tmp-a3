It is different from the anti-Japanese god drama, but the production level is at the TV drama level, and the good shots are all in the trailer. There is no surprise at all. They begin to deploy drones with large-caliber machine guns. In the back, they are getting worse and worse, and there are no beautiful movements. It will take half a year for you to shoot this movie, and it will take decades for that family to finish shooting a TV series. When Wu Jing makes such a stupid movie, he still has the nerve to talk about birthday gifts, this and that. Anyway, I will not go to see Kill Wolf.
