It's inspirational. I'll take it! Life is so difficult, society is so reasonably indifferent, selfishness from their own point of view is not evil, but not boasted of goodness. I saw this film on the Hollywood movie channel in Taiwan, and now there are fewer and fewer films like "I'm not Pan Jinlian". But it feels that the films made in those poor years are very different from those deliberately made in those days.
