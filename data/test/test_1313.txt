I want to go back to two years ago and slap myself in the face to the one who once said, "the Korean movie is over." Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo What a terrible rain, ah, too high and clear, equivalent to not waste a brick, directly built the foundation of the whole building. The hour before, he laughed and thought, isn't it just a lot of play by a fool who talks about class transition? As a result, through a rain, emotion, tension, foreshadowing, turning, and contrast all came out, soaring into the sky and then falling to the bottom of the valley with a completely unexpected attitude, like a roller coaster, with comfortable audio-visual dispatch and exquisite rhythm control, especially the handling of several sections of montage with space and symbols, so that people could not help shouting shit. Although there are some passages taken for granted after careful consideration, the whole is still worthy of a master's work, not so much freehand brushwork, but not directly. The social issues wrapped by commercial elements are just right, and the mood of watching the movie is aroused in an all-round way. I was totally sucked in. Ah, shit, what nonsense I'm writing, but it's so awesome. I'm too excited to write a short essay.
