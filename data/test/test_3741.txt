Marvel II is getting better and bigger, and Iron Man 3 is really sad in retrospect. This film represents the top of the Hollywood entertainment film, the story is old-fashioned but the plot twists and turns and the rhythm is fast, the characters are flat but very three-dimensional, the action is wonderful, the special effects are spectacular, the IMAX is excellent, 3D is stupid, but it is worthy of top entertainment, and Don Stan Lee laughs so much.
