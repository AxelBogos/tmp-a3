This film left a deep impression on me, the process of the game reflects the human nature of seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages, and more often people are willing to hurt others to protect themselves, which is fully reflected in the scene of righteous man being whipped by others. Although guessed that the heroine will live to the end, but the outcome is still beyond my expectation, it is really a cycle of cause and effect.
