I feel that the film should be called "caring for Autistic Children". The plot is so weak and messy that I don't have the desire to watch it continuously for two hours. Looking at the word accountant, I wanted to find the sense of being an accountant. As a result, I found that I not only didn't learn well in professional courses, but also didn't know how to fight, didn't know how to shoot, didn't have money, and didn't have an autistic who could pick up girls.
The hostess smiles beautifully.
