Look good! look good! BBC has filmed Agatha for three years in a row, one of which is better than the other, and this one is the best. The advantage of not reading the original work is that you can guess the real killer with the ups and downs of the plot. At the moment of revealing the answer, I felt that I had thought of it and did not seem to think that this was the crux of the strange family. Instantly found the feeling of the thread, refreshing!
