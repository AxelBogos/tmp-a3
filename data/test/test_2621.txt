Andrew Nicole, Al Pacino. To put it snobbishly, you have to give so many stars to the name. The film was seen in primary school, but it has always been hard to forget. Some people say that the ending is not good, but as the man who is so weak and utilitarian, this ending is the best ending and the saddest ending.
