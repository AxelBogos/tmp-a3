I don't know why I got such a low score.
It is true that the actors are not very good, and the director seems to be lacking in the story, but on the whole, at least Samsung's achievements.
From the director's point of view, it may be clear who is the winner and who is the loser. The simple Xiang Wang met the secular and calculating Pei Gong, and failure may be inevitable. But is it the victorious man who has the last laugh? I prefer Xiang Wang's bully.
