The film was so successful that the mother received a lot of sympathy from the audience, but some people were guilty, but they were not guilty enough to die. isn't it selfish to kill everyone because they miss their daughter too much. There are a lot of BUG in this film, but most of them are overshadowed by her ruthlessness and the strong atmosphere of the ending. On the whole, it is good.
