191007 this is a simple evaluation that has not seen the original work and animation. Read it twice as fast, but this is not a negation of this work. I believe that the strength of the popular random change, the fullness of the story and the moderate progress are all relatively excellent. The storyline is relatively good, and even moved to tears in some places (maybe my tears are relatively low today). It is a very warm and warm story, we may not be able to fulfill our dreams, but even so, we should live every day as well as possible, this is my feeling. The emotional line is also more reasonable, and people are all very gentle and lovely. Because I don't know how the original work is, it is impossible to evaluate the degree of reduction of casting, but the acting skill of zdjr is still good, and if I don't play that kind of love, it is also very good, and I have a silly and lovely feeling!
