Nima made me very worried. After watching it, I didn't feel how much damage the war had caused to the woman's country and family. The hostess is a self-willed, unruly, hypocritical, self-righteous, naive and selfish rich girl who can't help herself. Every time something happens, her father will solve the problem. The biggest feeling after reading is that I hate this hostess very much.
