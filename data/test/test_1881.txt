The whole series is Alice's one-man show. Everything begins and ends because of her. Itself is a series of works that ignore logic, watching movies without brains, eyes and ears are enough. We complain about the halo of the protagonist who can't be killed, but also the GOT roar for the protagonist. The whole process sweaty palms, but also handsome several faces. You're all going to die down here. (the mark of the first movie seen by one)
