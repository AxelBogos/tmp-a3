The story is a good story, three people against a deceased, but in the end it turns into an insipid rebellious teenager, bitter wife and mother, MV-style homosexual love. The narrative is not realistic, but also a little clever, and finally fall into the expression of "make you cry". Oversaturated lighting and filter style pictures, the lens does not move much, the expression of emotion depends on music.
