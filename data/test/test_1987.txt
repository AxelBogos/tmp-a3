This film and the disaster of the python are my only two childhood nightmares. A very good monster disaster movie. The confined space in the cruise ship is not a low-IQ death, but a rational way to escape. Mercenary businessmen, simple-minded and unreasonable soldiers and calm crew, the three forces restrict and help each other. It is of pioneering significance for monsters to learn from aliens and cannibalism. It is interesting enough that there are Chinese elements in the film.
