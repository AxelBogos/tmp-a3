It resonates more with people like me who are tired of life than to be someone else to give up and pursue a new life. Unfortunately, it is not easy to escape from the old life and start all over again. People are always so awkward that they are obsessed when they pursue, they are bored when they have them, and they miss them when they lose them. When I watched the Last Tango in Paris, I didn't realize that Maria Schneider was so good-looking.
