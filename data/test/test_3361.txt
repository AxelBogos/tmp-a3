The director said that the purpose of making this film is to use Ip Man to express the history of Hong Kong. Q: why did you choose Ip Man to perform? is it because of the commercial success of another version of Ip Man? A: I didn't choose this. The producer asked me to make another movie about Ip Man, and I did it.
