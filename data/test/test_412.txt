A movie with special routines, small potatoes' joys and sorrows, father-son affection, chicken soup thick + real-life CS, two stars and one star to Zhang Tianai, who doesn't have much to run and sleep at the airport, and one star to the old version of Gu Yu, headed by Fan Wei. And finally, the Hong Kong old gun came to the mainland to make money!
