The film should have N functions, and this film can be regarded as a promotional film of the Egyptian National Tourism Administration. The key to this kind of film is to choose the right model, to meet the propaganda demands, to be mature, elegant, reserved, and restrained, which is quite consistent with the details of the city of Cairo; there is no need to say much about the scene and soundtrack; the theme and plot of the story must be very elegant, but it must be shallow, too deep, and it will be a headache and a headache.
