I like the feeling of being so easily immersed in music once in a while. The road to the cinema was full of twists and turns: the day before, I took the ticket and dropped it in front of my house without realizing it. I didn't find it at home for a long time. I went to the cinema and made a lot of attempts, so I returned, only to find it lying quietly on my doorstep. I just got wet by Rain Water. All day long, ○ has been motionless (ε = ○). So I went back to the cinema. I was a little late, but I caught up with it.
