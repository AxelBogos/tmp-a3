The last big Bean movie, which is also the best one, is the laughing point of the whole process. Values are old-school and anti-modern, and Rowan Atkinson, 63, complements the theme. For senior British agents, falling in love with beautiful women is always simple and natural, so that in this play, the heroine only needs to be beautiful, and her position and transformation are dispensable. Watch the movie on GV in September 2018.
