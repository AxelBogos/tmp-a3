All kinds of small colored eggs, all the characters who used to appear on the stage. For example, the restaurant of Shanzhi, the Baradei industry with the funny portrait of Shanzhi, the panda man, the slowly fruiting pirate regiment, the Wapolo encountered by the cherry blossom country, Crockdahl, the female emperor Hancock, Luo, the green hair barrier man, Prince Charming, and so on. It is also very straightforward to the war scene, especially domineering to Bo. The battle scene was much more refreshing than before, and the last wave of Ace was a little excited. All in all, fans to the movie, it is worth watching.
