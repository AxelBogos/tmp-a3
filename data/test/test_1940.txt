Hu Jinquan's editing and soundtrack are deeply rooted in the quintessence of traditional Chinese art, with a profound artistic conception of rhythm and rhythm. People in the dizzying editing, watching it changing space and time, changing movements and skills. Often with a static background picture, to set off the movement of the characters, between movement and stillness, full of dexterity and Zen. However, there are too many natural close-ups in this film, the red light of the sun, and the structure of the story is not very good.
