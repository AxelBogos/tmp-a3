I don't have any sense. I just want to say that I didn't understand the shooting methods and scene switching at that time, and it looked very uncomfortable. It seems that the director only wants to sit on the sidelines and describe the facts, but also seems to want to express his views through some exaggerated means. But I can't see what I'm trying to say. I have a headache. I don't believe everyone thinks it's good.
