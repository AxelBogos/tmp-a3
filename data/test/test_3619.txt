The core of the story is very similar to the moon. The fate of infinite reincarnation and the tragedy of human cloning, but Shou Ai adds love elements to make the tone of the work pure and romantic (although it is still the love of facial paralysis and facial paralysis). Does the emptying at the end represent the occasional burst of hope in the endless reincarnation?
