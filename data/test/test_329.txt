American Qiongyao drama, after watching it for a long time, it feels like pride and prejudice is the same story, the key is that the camera is so similar to Dudu. I can't understand where the relationship between Anne Hathaway and Jamie comes from, and where does the rejection of Wesley come from? Appearance is justice?
