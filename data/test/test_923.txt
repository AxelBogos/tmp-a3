7.9/10
I'll never watch war movies again, QAQ. It's so desperate. The film is very real, every character of the German soldier is well portrayed, but the most important role of Moeller is a little broken, the transformation is too abrupt and far-fetched, and the ending is a bit WTF, which can not escape the stereotype of this kind of film.
