It just shows the ecstasy of Europe and the United States in the 1930s, and Westerners' thinking about money, which is not very suitable for the taste of Easterners. It is impossible to get the recognition of universal values like "there is no war on the western front" at the same time. At the same time, there are too many characters, and it is a little messy to piece together a story. The story is not enough to depict the characters, although the protagonists are very handsome, very beautiful, but failed to leave a deep impression. Easterners may find it boring.
