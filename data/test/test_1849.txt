I think the overall is not bad. I guess I haven't seen a play like Shiqi for too long. The mask: finally, the scene of the children running to the poisonous gas is so shocking; the earthbound: I don't like it! Sea Thief Special: sure enough, the story of the second dimension to the third dimension is very uncomfortable, but Uncle Kuan and Lufei are so handsome! When I finally saw Sonny, I burst into tears; the House of insects: the screenwriter's brain is too big; the man who believes in himself: such good skills have been abandoned by you!
