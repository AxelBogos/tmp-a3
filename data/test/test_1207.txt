The rule of survival in the west: when you get old, you should retire; a novice should not rob a bank, even if the cashier is an old man; magical stories cannot be popular forever; if you leave leeway, you will be blessed by heaven; put aside your curiosity and follow the team steadily; choose the wrong travel companion, and the carriage may also be hell.
