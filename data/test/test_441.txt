On the evening of August 22, 2013.08.22, I remember that the first time I saw the shoes was in the movie appreciation class of my sophomore year, which was originally used to sleep or play with my mobile phone, but at that time, the player put away his phone and looked up. Everyone silently and seriously finished watching this chicken-catching Iranian movie, and finally many girls cried. I was always a person with a high tear point, and my eyes were wet at that time.
