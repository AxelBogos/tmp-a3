It's really ugly that in recent years, the only movie that I can't watch anymore, the main actress, the child, is too noisy, too hard, and the special effects plot is far worse than one, and that's 7.7 points, which is also satisfied with the licking of some people in Douban at the beginning, whether the Chinese speak Shanghainese or Cantonese or Manchu, the mask and stereotype are too serious, and those wearing headscarves are Sikhs and Hindus. What does Shiva have to do with Spielberg making so many common sense mistakes? it's a waste of time.
