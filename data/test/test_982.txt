The accident in the journey, the horn before the decisive battle. Griffith parallel editing maintains the epic narrative framework, but the depth of the play is very limited, there is no new development in the connection between the core ring and the world, and the alliance and separation between ethnic groups degrade into simplified character choice. the best part of the offensive and defensive battle is also very unconvincing. The whole panorama has the trend of aesthetic fatigue, only Gollum is outstanding. [4/10]
