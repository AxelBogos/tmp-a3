What else can I say... There are no words to describe it. I don't want to comment on this film, but I think the artistic level of the best foreign language film Oscar over the years is higher than that of Cannes Palme d'Or. You may not like the five films nominated, but they definitely represent the visual presentation of countries about history, status quo, values and art.
