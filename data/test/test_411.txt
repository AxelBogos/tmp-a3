My mother said that Hua Zai was not good at acting and singing, so he didn't understand what I liked about him at that time. I seldom pay attention to him in recent years, and I don't listen to new songs without watching movies every year. Until I thought of the film after "Blind Detective" and burst into tears this night, I didn't know if I was moved or hurt.
