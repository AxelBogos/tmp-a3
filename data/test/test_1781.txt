Love this movie, this kind of multi-line narrative, each of the three stories is wonderful, seemingly insipid and rich in detail, meaningful; they are independent of radio music, gunshots and trains in parallel. The first paragraph of the story of two young Japanese lovers is particularly interesting. The girl compares Elvis and Buddha, the Statue of Liberty and Madonna. The portrait of waiting is a masterstroke.
