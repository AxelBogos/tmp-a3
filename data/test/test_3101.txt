I really need this theatrical version. 20 consecutive theatrical editions are full of tears. It is not only the hype, but also the addition of a new generation of characters, and the theme is more in-depth-maybe each of us in the Pokemon Dream wants to be a forever simple person insulated from the darkness of reality, and the end of the film also fulfilled the 20-year dream of animation fans, no matter what the future, will continue to go on. Other mirrors and paintings are great.
