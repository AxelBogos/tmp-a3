Although the aunt can guess the story behind it from the beginning, it is still a very useful subject matter. Unfortunately, the script is so weak that the connections between all the characters have not been clearly explained. What was the relationship between the hostess and the aunt at that time? apart from the resentment between the hostess and Mercedes before the reunion in the casino, the hostess noticed when the aunt's daughter stopped going to school. At that time, who were the boys who pretended to be Ben? they didn't explain all of them. A large part of it was devoted to psychological transformation, but the film was very insipid. The heroine was not a very kind person, and could not afford the strong and brave final girl. Compared with the third season of the TV version of "Scream," it was much worse. How did this kind of film get Octavia Spencer to take the lead, and there were so many big-name guest stars? maybe the director was too popular.
