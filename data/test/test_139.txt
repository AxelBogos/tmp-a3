I don't know what to say. I think Ang Lee has mastered Western narrative art, just like the disappearance of immersion in JIM movies. Maybe Taiwanese already have the ability to narrate insipid, and so is Hou Hsiao-hsien and Yang Dechang. In the face of love, everyone is equal, regardless of attack, race or gender.
