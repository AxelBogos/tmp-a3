The scariest part of the film is that tooth. Station A watched it online, Taiwan translated subtitles, all kinds of jumps. The bridge section is very old-fashioned and the special effects are very primitive. I believe that there are no real ghosts in this film. I don't know what the director's complex is so faithful to restore the color of the teeth.
