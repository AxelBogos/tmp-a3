The book I read in junior high school or high school is actually quite wonderful. I like a few actors in the movie, but I think it is very sad that who has not loved the wrong person, but the protagonist of the novel is always very miserable. The songs of ten years ago in the movie, Nokia, Han Han are all so familiar, maybe it is for this resonance.
