No matter how many words of aggression are all aggression, no matter how many words are expounded, they cannot cover up the facts. The film throws the proposition to the audience, but the audience does not necessarily resist. Now the images of many "primitive tribes" are just taking off their pants and naked buttocks for the sake of filming needs. And all the sad people's actions are followed by a different sense of superiority. The soundtrack is great.
