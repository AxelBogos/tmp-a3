Francis' impeccable shot again can only be said to be at its peak, but it's a pity that Robert de Niro's supporting role for Alpacino annoys me, although it's the plot that needs it, but can't you be the main character? not arranging a bed scene for Diane Keaton is definitely a pity for godfather fans, because in the third movie, there will be no chance.
