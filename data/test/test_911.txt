It's shocking! The scenes of the German fascists were so cruel that I left a shadow when I was a child. In the West, many films reflecting the fascist crimes of World War II have been produced, all of which are very excellent. I also hope that more and better films can be made in China, so that the whole world can understand the heinous crimes committed by Japan's invasion of China during World War II.
