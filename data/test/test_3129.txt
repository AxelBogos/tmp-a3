It's a story about traveling through time and space. It is a little bit about environmental protection, because the problems of the earth's environment want to go back to the past and let the super-capable people solve the environmental problems. The clips between the hero and heroine about superpowers and some memories of the past are very good! In the end, I was surprised that the hostess 4CV was Yo-Yo Ma. I felt that it felt good to be a good voice for the first time.
