After watching it for more than ten hours, I was really not in the mood to watch it. For example, the posture of Chen Qiaoen's deaf-mute girl, knowing that there were more old stalks in addition to the suicide obstruction that had already appeared, decided not to embarrass herself to finish watching the original tvb play, which had not been seen for more than a decade. From the point of view of the movie, it was really bad.
