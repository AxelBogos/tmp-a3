The core of hope under the shell of despair, the theme of love in the form of death. There is no need to stop where there is despair, and there are "only flowers" where there is despair. Naturally, it is not made up of pixels. The black and white subtitle at the end is death, and it is also the end of death. The most exciting movie I have seen so far this year, the great satisfaction of ears, eyes and brain, sound effects and editing and color. Chi Song's play is much more unexpected is really a surprise, the film guest appearance of the women's band is Chai, is it chai! Missed the Lebei Film Festival and the last screening, and caught up with what may be the last screening. Which music festival in China, please we are little zombies it, as well as, hurry up with resources ah!
