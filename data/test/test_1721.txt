I went to school to see the rehearsal last night. I finally got two free seats. I lived up to expectations, and the whole audience laughed. Although many jokes do not understand what meaning, only native Americans can understand the humor, but it is still very happy. I recommend you to see it. This may be one of the funniest movies this year. PS, likes the leading actor Big Pang Jonah Hill very much.
