8.3 this is a highly visual and stylized adaptation of Macbeth. Macbeth's death in this adaptation is not the end of him, but the re-discovery and continuation of the character. There are still many stylized adaptations of the original works in this film, and at the same time, it is also a feast of performance, with both Ma Liang and French Sharks giving Oscar-level performances.
