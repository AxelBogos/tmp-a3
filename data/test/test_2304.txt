Actually, I want to give it a score of 5.5, but I can't help it. I really love he Zhengyu too much. The film abandons the nonsensical style of the original cartoon, but makes the playful mixture of Eastern and Western myths and religions look irrelevant, and many scenes look like page games. Compared with visual effects, what is more exciting are spatio-temporal strategies and narrative skills. Of course, there are also pearls in front of them. Looking forward to the next story of King Yan Luo and Prince Jianglin falling in love with each other in the past life and this life.
