One second their equipment is decent, the next their task is like a child's play, the characterization is very weak, coupled with the weird editing points, the film always has an inexplicable sense of disharmony in rhythm, and at last I finally understand. it turns out that this French theme is just like our red movie. Xiaomi plus rifles beat the tank cannons of the Japanese devils, dare the Taliban to be stupid. ★★
