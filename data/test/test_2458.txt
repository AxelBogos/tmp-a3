The Buddha, Moni, the Buddhist monk, saw this film and angrily took Sharizi back. I said how Zhao Wei was a vase. When she didn't have a single line, she began to chat up Jiang Wen and formally flirted with her desire to talk. If you think a good actor, you don't pick up bad movies. For example, Jiang Wen and Wang Xueqi. I was wrong. There are times when a good actor owes the director a favor, maybe the friendship of a small friend. Anyway, a skilful wife cannot make bricks without rice.
