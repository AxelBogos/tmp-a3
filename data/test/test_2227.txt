The greatest courtroom play ever! The definition and extension of national interests and humane justice, personality glory and human original sin, judicial procedure and ethics almost reach the limit of human beings. Behind every irrefutable lawsuit, there is power ready to move; behind every high-sounding defense, there is confession that is difficult to deal with. "there are some things that even God can't do." and is it not a pawn in the overall game as a judge who is a substitute for God to judge others?
