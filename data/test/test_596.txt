Ghosts are very popular in Korea in recent years, similar to Coco. Looks like a pot of messy elements, the use of special effects, scene switching is very complex, but overall shows a complete and full of human suffering, that is, the rules are a little messy. The audience can choose to think about a deeper level of human nature. I like he Zhengyu's mature yuppie actor temperament too much. Uncle Zhengjai showed up by surprise. Korean movies have come to this.
