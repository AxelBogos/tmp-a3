Not a fan of Wolverine, I probably have no feeling for Marvel's superheroes, this one is better, and the others are basically special effects from beginning to end, the plot is childish and bleak, and the portrayal and characterization of the characters are extremely thin. My impression is that the character stays in the two-dimensional plane, far from being three-dimensional, which is always the fatal weakness of comic book films.
