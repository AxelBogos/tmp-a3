When I saw that woman, I wondered if I accidentally ordered the love film. Later, I found that I had been waiting for the hero to get rid of the woman. I didn't expect the woman to follow until the end of the film. The surprise was that the psychiatrist praised the woman and the hero answered it was worth it.
I just want to say, well, it's worth it. It's a bad movie.
