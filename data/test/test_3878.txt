I remember that more than ten years ago, when I was a child who had just entered primary school, I kept giggling when I read the lie. I watched it five or six times in a row, and I thought it was very funny. But a few days ago, I happened to see it on TV, and when I watched it again, I couldn't laugh anymore. Those scenes that I thought were very parody and humorous at that time, but now I feel sad and helpless. Looking back, I was really too young at that time. I didn't understand a lot of things. I simply thought that laughing was really smiling.
