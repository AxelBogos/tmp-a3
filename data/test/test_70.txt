The first part is Yuan Heping's northern faction, and the second part is the cooperation between Jackie Chan and Liu Jialiang, which is also one of the rare cooperation between the northern faction and the southern school, with the highest achievement. The third part is the Southern School dominated by Liu Jialiang and Liu Jiahui.
