It's exaggerated, but it's not embarrassing. There are three AMC screenings in Seattle on Wednesday night. The cinemas are full. App shows sold out directly. All the worst seats have been sold. There is no such thing in Star Wars. The atmosphere is so good! PS: this film basically gathers all the Asian stars in Hollywood, and there are colored eggs at the end of the film.
