In Dolby Cinema, the sound details are indeed excellent and rich, and the most effective is the bass, because of the chair tremor. But overall, the sense of sound space has not improved, because the sound effect of this film (and most action / science fiction blockbusters) is too full. It would be interesting to have a special sound design. The movie itself is about how the SW series can go on and on, and it's scary to think about it.
