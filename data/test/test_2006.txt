Does the man's three white eyes really fit the role? As the saying goes, if you don't die, you won't die. Still feel able to enter the world of this hospital (to borrow proper nouns! ) people are really mentally ill (the most serious is a deep well ice face), first of all, no problem people do not want to step into this damn place. The madman can come in and only the madman can go out. In fact, the mental hospital which desperately needs the audience and takes any door is so loving. =
