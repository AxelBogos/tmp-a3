Like a documentary, because it is too realistic, it does not take sides, like a calm god of death looking at the blood of the world. This film is an exemplary work of European films criticizing colonialism. Some emotions remind me of the book thieves I read recently. the author once said that at the same time, great human dignity and cruel human violence coexist. It's a good movie.
