There is no sincerity at all, it is all freeze-frame pictures, the plot has nothing to do with the main line of TVA, and the theme is not serious at all. Originally, the second season of the TV version was already very bad, and there was such a thing to make up for it. This film is really determined to follow the seed, isn't it?
