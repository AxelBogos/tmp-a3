Strangely, for five seconds, I couldn't remember what the heroine looked like. My mind was full of Jim Carrey's exaggerated action expressions and the squeak of her neck. Comedy is to have the appearance of comedy, don't be wordy, don't be sissy, the heroine can't be a vase, the sweet and spicy meat is smart, you can't hold the hero back, mm-hmm.
