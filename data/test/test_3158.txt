The layout of classic horror movies, plus the serial series of puppets. The feeling of being ununderstood and helpless is really depressing. Just think about how to deal with this kind of thing. I'm afraid I'm on my own. The horror movies of 1990 basically gathered all the classic scenes of that era, especially the toy factory, which reminded me of Uncle Schwarzenegger's Terminator era and paid tribute to him.
