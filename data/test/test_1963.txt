Don't dare to mark the stream of consciousness movie after watching. If I had a child of my own, I would come and see it again. The complexity of showing the growth of a person or family is breathtaking, but Terrence did it. Not only is the artistic conception and philosophy, he can make a lens cause infinite thinking. The most important moment in life is in childhood, countless memories and thoughts will eventually be attributed to childhood, the initial exploration and thinking of the world.
