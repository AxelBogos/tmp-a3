An extremely sad fable: [You can't change who people are without destroying who they were]. You can change a person only by destroying one person. And in the end, everyone's happy ending is that they have never appeared in each other's world. The butterfly effect is full of bug, but people who are very affectionate and intelligent can't watch it. It will hurt after reading it.
