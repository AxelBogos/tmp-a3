When I saw Jia Zhangke's film for the first time, I was sad but not sad, worried but not resentful, delicate and not tedious. Looking at the bustling and unfathomable world from the small helplessness of small potatoes, it is not sensational but really heart-blocking. Almost every character on the stage is very plump. In the modern Chinese film century full of meaningless ancient costume martial arts films, it is really a conscientious and conscientious work. What a compliment!
