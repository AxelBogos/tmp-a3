I think this film was introduced by China Film Film in accordance with the standards of Hollywood blockbusters. At least that's what they think. But the quality of the film is actually quite mediocre. All kinds of special effects have been xswl. I will not talk about all kinds of logical confusion and contradictions in the plot. The biggest regret and the biggest pity is that it has not been made into a duo film. White blind Yunton and Longer, this pair of fierce men. It is also the theme of prison break, and the quality of the film is about the same as that of "Golden Cicada out of Shell 2".
