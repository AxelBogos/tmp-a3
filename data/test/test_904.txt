People always like to sweat, which has nothing to do with the season. The beads of sweat on the skin are as disgusting and sticky as caterpillars. I tried to scratch them off with my fingers, but most of them ended up with bloodstains. In the dry season, this feeling is infinitely magnified, making people extremely depressed. In the past, I thought that as long as I became like everyone else, this delusion would disappear. But I was wrong. Now, I just want a heavy rain to wash away the depraved dirt.
