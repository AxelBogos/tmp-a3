I really don't know what to say. It's like watching a newcomer make a screenplay. I feel that as long as there is a treacherous setting, everything will be ready. Who knows that the completely non-expressive script, plot, photography and performance make the story not only empty, but also a little neurotic even in that treacherous setting. Besides, is there something wrong with the styling brain? What are the three actors wearing?
