This kind of biographical film is really difficult to please ordinary filmmakers, like gnawing on a bone, as if a little meat, as if the taste is very fresh, but the bite is too hard. I also belong to ordinary moviegoers. I really think it's boring, except for Nicole's face and the beauty of the desert.
