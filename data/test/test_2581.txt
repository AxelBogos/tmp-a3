[6 points] roughly similar to the core of a lost lover, but there is really something wrong with the rhythm. It begins to be divided by characters, but it is divided by time in the later stage, which is extremely chaotic. Because the rhythm is slow and there is no emotional tipping point, the soundtrack of the whole film is simply rampant. It is this man who is rarely disgusting in this year's movie.
