I looked at her and looked at her again and again. For the rest of my life, wholeheartedly. What I love most is her, for sure, as sure as I must die. In the past, the witch like flowers, now only withered leaves return home, pale, vulgar, bloated, the flesh and blood in the belly is someone else's, but I love her, she can fade, she can fade, whatever, but I only look at her, all kinds of tenderness, surging into my heart.
