I was convinced that Luc Besson was now as depraved as John Woo, not to mention the story, it was so lame, dragging and boring, and it was not easy to wait for the first action scene at the beginning of an hour. as a result, the editing was a terrible mess. I can cut this material better than this. No wonder even the publicity is not publicized, and the film has its own number in mind.
