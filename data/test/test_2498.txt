I have been curious about the new revelations of changing stream-of-consciousness novels into movies. Proust himself may be moved by it, but as I, who have not finished my original work and want to understand it as a movie, it is naive to have such an idea. It is impossible to understand the film without reading the original work. It needs to be reviewed with a little knowledge.
