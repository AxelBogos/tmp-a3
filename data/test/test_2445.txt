At first, I just wanted to practice listening, but later I found that these movies were very good. What we see today is that plata quemada,plata means silver. Here it must refer to the money that quemada burned down. So the literal translation should be "burned money". I have no depth. I'm sorry. But in any case, it's better than some South American male thief who thought it was an old-fashioned Hong Kong movie.
