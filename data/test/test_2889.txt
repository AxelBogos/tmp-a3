ST50 year, accompanied by the story of growing up, exploring the unknown world, achieving world harmony, imperceptibly integrated into personal values. In TOS, which was born during the Cold War, Russians worked as pilots on starships, American women became language officers, and alien scientific advisers. At a time when the economy is lost and globalization is regressing, let's tell the story of a starship that has been broken up and reunited. Such a mind and vision, to me, is the greatest charm of ST.
