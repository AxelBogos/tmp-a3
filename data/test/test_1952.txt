Three points. The whole process, including the camera movement, seems to be played at double speed, and it is interspersed with too many close-up slow shots, making it look like a MV. The picture is really beautiful, but the sense of creation is too heavy. Chen Xiao and du Juan have no sense of CP at all. The characters are morbid, and they are apt to start prose poetry mode. The only thing that is normal is superfluous.
