I understand that a person who plays a star in this movie is like watching a beautiful woman on the road, you see the whole person, you say wow is beautiful, but he only sees a hair, saying that this hair is beautiful?! The ignorant is innocent, but as far as I am concerned, this hair is really beautiful enough.
