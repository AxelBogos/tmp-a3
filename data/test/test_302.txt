Rushing to Jiang Jiajun's new version of The Legend of the Condor Heroes, which was once directed by Jiang Jiajun, I thought the starring lineup must have been ruined at the beginning. I didn't expect to see the trailer and the feature film really good. I didn't like the male lead at first, but now it seems to be really fragrant. I've seen the male TV series "take my Brother away" really well, and the heroine Zhao Min is really smart, and the feeling is still in line with it. And this play looks like a big production from the special effects, martial arts instructors are obviously the intention to shoot to do, the vision is also good, not bright white looks very comfortable!
