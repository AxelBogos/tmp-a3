The leading actor is good. But the illiterate face is cold all the time, and there is only one word in the heart of the two groups of villains, md mentally retarded. So I can't understand the laughter of the French audience. Maybe it was a good movie in those days. Maybe the whole film only feels about the rescued family waiting outside the door to say thank you. I feel that Quentin feels a lot like this painting style.
