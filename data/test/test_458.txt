You don't really understand until you're at least 30.
What's it like to crave?
And then as you get older,
This feeling will get stronger and stronger.
Because the desire is getting stronger and the possibility is getting less and less.
The past year is getting faster and faster.
Because it's only a small part of your whole life.
