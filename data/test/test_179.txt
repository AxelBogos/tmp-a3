Brought into the turbulent era of the 17th century, full of war and sadness, there is no lack of the most sincere feelings, that kind of deep love with blood and tears, the feelings between men without words, the heroic blood of that era is shown incisively and vividly. The pictures of the film are like oil paintings from the 17th century. In fact, the scene in the oil painting is indeed recreated in the film, and the scene of the Dutch surrender to Spain is in the oil painting of Velazquez at the Prado Museum in Madrid.
