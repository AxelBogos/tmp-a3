The first film is very novel, the second SONY is well-made, but this third film is really rubbish, shooting the forest is not as good as shooting it directly in the suburbs with a mobile phone. Snake, special effects are absolutely dregs, absolutely beginners' level, snakes have no sense of reality, obviously there is only one snake, then how can it be a male and a female? The hostess is beautiful!
