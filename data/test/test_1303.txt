The soldiers of the guerrillas are so versatile. How do they manage to take down a large group of people with three bullets and speak German fluently? When I was a child, I heard a crosstalk say that a child learned from Walter to go to the room to block the chimney. Why didn't I find this section? Great people of Sarajevo!
