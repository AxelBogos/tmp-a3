Two and a half stars. Claimed to be the box office champion of Korean film history, it is not as good as Thailand, which is made in China. The plot is a copycat version of the Eleven Lohan, almost entirely supported by Quan Zhixian's sexy lazy face and beautiful legs. (strange, I suddenly know how to appreciate her beauty)
