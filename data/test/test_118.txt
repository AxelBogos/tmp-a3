This piece is really heart-wrenching for employees. Those pains / knots / shadows / things that make you regret should exist in the bottom of everyone's heart. You can choose to forget the past, but the past will not forget you. Even if buried deep, do not want to turn, can not bear to see, do not want to be known by others â€¦ But that ridge, it's still there. How to mend, how to calm, how to forgive... This can be regarded as the great test of life. You are always the hardest to beat.
