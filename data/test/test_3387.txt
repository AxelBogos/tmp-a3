At first glance
What a vulgar beginning
It's stereotyped.
And after the emergence of iron-blooded soldiers, I felt a little disappointed.
The Iron Warriors are not handsome at all.
And without Ripley.
I wonder if it's still Fox's work.

But, look, look.
The competition between hunters and aliens attracted me.
After reading it all, burst out:
Classic.
This science fiction movie.
We still have to innovate.
