The style is similar to the labyrinth of Pan God, all are realistic fairy tales, Pan God is more euphemistic, classic two narrative lines. And the monster summons is to turn off the fairy tale "escape" function, teaching a child how to deal with powerless things: can not be strong, but eventually learn to overcome themselves. Ink special effects are very beautiful, simple stories, rare ways of expression, profound core. But many people may not accept this style of fairy tales.
