Samsung half, from the timing point of view, is probably the mainstream market after Cao Baoping's "Glorious anger" after the brightest domestic Virgo. Most of the problem lies in the ending, imitating the fighting game and news interpretation, which seriously damaged the overall picture style and story rhythm that Urshan worked hard to build for more than an hour. The failure in the ending directly affected my overall evaluation of the whole film.
