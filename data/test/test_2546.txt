Apart from the unknown reasons for the broken family relationship, everything else is so classic! Horror comes from an unknown creepy atmosphere, not a female ghost who startles you. The push and follow shots in the film are used just right, plus Kubrick's favorite metal noise and the superb performances of Nicholson and Duvall. Maybe Shining is no better than today's horror movies, but the feeling of horror and horror was absolutely unprecedented in 1980. The most frightening thing is the hearts of the people, even if the whole warm tone does not give people a chance to breathe.
