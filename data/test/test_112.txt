It is said that he is the originator of westerns and film editing. I don't love westerns very much. for old films, this film is really well cut and basically fluent. I find that I particularly like this kind of silent film which can tell a complete story by not speaking. The piece that hit people and threw the dummies off the top of the train was too fake, and the man in the Telegraph room at the back was also a little fake when he got up, but it was fun.
