It's really perfect. It must be brushed two times, three times and four times. Every shot is extremely elaborate, he is not only practicing the textbook, he is simply defining the textbook, some aura moments really make me tremble all over.
The value that Spielberg conveys, that is, the restriction of supreme power is certainly not the whole idea of the American political system, but he is indeed doing something like this: to break down the Constitution of the United States into entries, starting with figures at all levels of history, to demonstrate the most fundamental contract of human society: the equality of Lincoln and the judicial justice of the Bridge of spies. The Washington Post involves not only freedom of speech and publication, but also the awakening of female consciousness, which is actually a review of previous works and care for reality. Spielberg can always dig up such stories from history, polish them, and he's still on his way.
