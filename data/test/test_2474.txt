Jiushi's soundtrack, wife's husband Mucong Shu Xilin and so on, slow rhythm and properly rendered gloomy, as well as handle Ben Ming! His acting skills that are so in place that they can no longer be in place! However, it is a bit strange for the ten-day newspaper to give this film the first place of the year, which is a long way from the "confession". It is a world where "there is no pity for the death of the wicked, and no good for the good". The script still has a six-fold structure, but I still feel that the best part is not enough.
