Dennis Velenueva's masterpiece, a gripping suspense thriller. Although logically failed to eliminate the loophole, the flaws outweigh the flaws. Jack Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman are excellent actors, the photography is cold and dark, the narrative is step by step, and there is a lot of information that doesn't let the audience breathe even at the last minute. The religious revelation throughout the film and the metaphor of clinging to the title of the film make the film more ideological, and everyone is a prisoner in the labyrinth. (9.0 take 10)
