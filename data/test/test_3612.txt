The script has new ideas, creative ways of expression (such as how to design the lines of two characters), and the 3D effect is also good. But if it can be called a divine work, I'm afraid the cinema will be full of divine works. Monotonous narrative line, egg pain groans, "after watching it, they all hold their breath and touch the heartstrings for the hostess?" Why don't I feel anything? PS had an independent movie Moon a few years ago, which was actually better. Is it really because I mentioned the Heavenly Palace and Shenzhou of the Great China? laugh.
