Garbage film. It's pointless. Everyone has privacy, and sometimes some lies are white. This society needs lies. Not everyone has to be noble, we must believe in certain religions, and we have the right to choose the way we like to live. Life is your own, and you don't need God to arrange it for you. We ourselves are at the helm of life. Moreover, a stranger has no right to command us to do anything.
