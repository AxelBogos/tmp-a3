"isn't it handsome for a man to walk his life firmly?" What surprised me in this theatrical version was that both Lufei and Z openly admitted that it was personal needs, not the well-being of the public, that guided their actions. Z wanted to destroy the sea because he hated pirates. Luffy fought against Z in order to be the king of pirates. In a society where everyone likes to wear a big hat, the more "cute" bad guys, the better.
