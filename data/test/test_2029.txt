There was a lot of success at the beginning, but I found that the process was too undramatic. The rest of the story seems a little procrastinating, but the scene of entering the alien world is still shocking. Ps: the marriage between science and faith is really not as beautiful as it is in the movies. It is possible to hover around the stage of burying explosives for each other. However, five stars still have to be given!
