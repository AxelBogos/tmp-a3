Very disappointed.
I didn't notice where the film was invested.
It's really rotten.
If you can't produce a new script, you should work hard.
You are fastidious about making rough editing.
It's a mess. You can give some strength to the special effects in the later stage.
In the later stage, the special effects are all made into second-rate advertising.
What else do you want me to see?
