The best part of a movie is Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, which lasts for 15 minutes. Will you be drowsy, or will you burst into tears? If 80% of people choose the latter, should they watch this movie? Uncle Gypsy's Paganini Capriccio is also very warm-blooded! France and Russia are in tune, but the pace is super fast, the plot is humorous, the characters are full of characters, and the emotional accumulation is slowly overflowing, too strong!
