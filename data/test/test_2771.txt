Perhaps every punch on the protagonist is not only the result of training, but also the bitterness of failure, the trouble of the family, the pressure of his girlfriend. Maybe the story is exaggerated, but the protagonist's situation is still lifelike and gripping. Every beating tested his patience and persistence. It was sweat and persistence, not the final punches that attracted me.
