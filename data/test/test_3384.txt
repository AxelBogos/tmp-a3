Those who break the rules will die; those who know the rules too well will retire; those who have the ability and intention to innovate can only escape; in the end, those who are left with the so-called rules are the maintainers of the so-called rules. I think this is the reason for the ultimate decline of martial arts, and it may also be the sorrow of every era.
