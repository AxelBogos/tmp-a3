Chen Kaige's best commercial blockbuster shows a panoramic view of history in nearly three hours. The depth of similar themes is far more than "Hero", and the construction of drama conflict is better than "Banquet". A complete aesthetic system was constructed, which made the later "Zhao Orphan" look like a clown. It is highly artistic and, to some extent, highly realistic. The naked analysis of human nature in a paradoxical atmosphere exposes Qin Shihuang's fragility and cruelty to the audience at the same time.
