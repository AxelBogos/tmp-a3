What kind of film is this? there are flaws everywhere, whether it is the actions of the gang, the organizational leadership relationship between the boss and the younger brother, and the process of the drug trade are all full of loopholes, that is, the despicable and funny performances of the two gangs that are self-righteous and even cover their ears. I don't see any cleverness, but I still have to pretend to be deep and unfathomable! Many people who have seen the movie want to post classic signatures. I can only say that you are thinking too much.
