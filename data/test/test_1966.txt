The heroine is a foolish and sweet woman, with three concepts of mystery and extremely unstable combat effectiveness to fully serve the plot. The whole story is that the heroine is discovered, inspired, seduced and energized by the heroine, and finally the man who has not yet received the bento is comprehensive. Madman anti-girl 2 could have been an evil boss, but he had to turn his motivation into a desire for men's attention. The plot is awkward, and it collapses directly in order to reverse those who have not yet gained a foothold. Feminist Chaoying should be more than that.
