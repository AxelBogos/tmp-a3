When I looked at the deadly phone before, others complained that it was copy Hawkeye. But when I really saw Hawkeye, there was a feeling of smashing the computer! Messy plot, exaggerated family feelings! And the otherwise insensitive government collectively became an understanding angel in the last few minutes. However, it is commendable that computer stunts, explosion effects and so on, do a really good job!
