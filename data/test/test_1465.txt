It is false to say that I was not moved. My only tear point when watching the movie was that Xiaoqiang had a fever and my mother went to the temple to kowtow and pray. It is a pity that since then, I have completely entered the mode of sentimental bitter drama, with the logic of the film and the artificial performance of the actors. I really don't deserve too much praise.
