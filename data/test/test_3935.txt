2008. Summer vacation is said to be a satirical film. It turned out to be ironic. Then this film is easy to explain. That's a dark sense of humor. The series style can be maintained, except for the evolution of the picture, everything else is deteriorating. I forgot to add it. Because I won't watch it again, just add it.
