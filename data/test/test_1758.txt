In fact, the plot is also the best seller's consistent "to cover up the crimes committed by loved ones". He has read this routine for the fourth time since "the dedication of suspect X", "White Night Walk" and "Phantom Night", but he still cries like a fool. Kaga Konichiro series has read a book "New entrants" before. It doesn't feel bad, it's good, but it doesn't feel particularly good. I didn't expect the film to be so infectious. I don't want to pause or watch the progress bar for a long time. The narrative is smooth and clear, sensational and not excessive. Each time I rely on the delicate text in front of me to push the audience's mood to its peak, supplemented by gentle and emotional soundtrack. So this series is over, too. I wonder if the best seller has a new series. PS didn't think the heroine was so beautiful. Everyone kept saying that "Beauty" was really subtle, just like Matsuko in the Quartet. PSS hostess Lori period of the actress I said how so familiar, it turned out to be "Tokyo Ghoul" real-life version of the prototype. The acting is good, and I am particularly impressed by my pitiful appearance. The male lead is cute and has big eyes for acting.
