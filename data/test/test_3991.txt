One brush missed too much, changed to a big cinema second brush, the impression is sure enough fit. The second brush picked up all the clues about the themes of eyes, memory, love, ghost mother and finding a father. I liked the ending and had a sense of empathy with the storyteller, "Thank you for giving me a good story ending." so much so that I ended up in tears in the cinema.
