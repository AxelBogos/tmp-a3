After reading the mysterious feeling deliberately created in front of me, I didn't make it clear in the end, and the slow pace is acceptable, but you have to tell the story clearly, everyone's style is inexplicable, is it true that wolf is to see who doesn't know why? The dead are all inexplicably dead, and there are many dead thieves. When they disagree with each other, they set up machine guns to shoot and slaughter a large number of police officers, just for the sake of being happy? I'm serious about it, but... Maybe I can't understand the director's intention.
