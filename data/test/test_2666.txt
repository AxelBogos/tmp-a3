Anthony Fuquia's version of King Arthur looks like his future film "heroic Seven Dragons", with the same plot and similar texture. This is not King Arthur, but more like a dim king who is indecisive. It's not the Knights of the Round Table, it's more like a dirty gang. Only the epic prologue and the low ebb before the war moved me.
