This is actually directed by Gavin Belson in Silicon Valley. What a surprise! Apart from the fact that the latter part is not very smooth, everything else is great. The clean and bright picture, the character is super suitable for the super-good Viggo Mortensen and these small actors with the right cast, it is a very good and suitable family film. It's like a clean stream in the recent movie:)
