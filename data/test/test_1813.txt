40apt 100 is intended to reflect on Hong Kong education, but the story really lacks sincerity. Basically, it can be said that the previous plot template of "Personality teacher + rebellious students" has been fired again, and all the twists and turns are too naive or even naive. In order to maximize the utilization of Donnie yen, a lot of action plays and stories have been added, but in fact, the creation of this part is also quite distracted. I think it is obviously not enough to explore Zhen's market in other types of films.
