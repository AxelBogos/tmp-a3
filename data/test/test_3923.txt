The whole time I was wondering how Nolan could have shot such a stupid plot. The problem is that I have finished reading it. After watching it, I remembered that there was too much difference between this and the trailer, ðŸ˜‚. As soon as I thought about it, I saw a fake Dunkirk. I may have been out of my mind recently, but I didn't feel right until I finished reading it. Wasted more than 90 minutes of my life. I may be a retarded ðŸ˜‚.
