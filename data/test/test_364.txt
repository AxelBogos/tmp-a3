I can't stand the male police completely when I see the fourth episode. If it's based on the real story, I don't know how he got admitted to the police. In the play, there is a great disparity in strength between the two opposing sides. Malvo is like a god, unassailable. Molly, the only policewoman who can be called an opponent, has a lot of pig teammates dragging his feet. If the last two bandits ran into Lester with a knowing smile, they would have given up.
