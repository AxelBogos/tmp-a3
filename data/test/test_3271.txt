Compared with this film, the pot head and the all-metal shell are far worse than the description of the war, which is much better than the melody of Hacksaw Ridge. This broken wall, the fear and tyranny of war, buries the grief of comrades-in-arms. The description of Russian tank players, captains and Chechen commanders all have their own characteristics. War is really cruel. May there be no war in this life.
