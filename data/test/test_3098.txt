Looking at Lan Yu, I will unwittingly cross to Lu Zhen. I also have to love someone so much. I love so carefully step by step. I am always afraid that I will not only get hurt in the end. Lan Yu left all the best time in his life to the man he loved, but the man suddenly realized that he needed him so much when he disappeared into the crowd. When I think of the last song at the end of the film, it is very touching.
