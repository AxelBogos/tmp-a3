The expression of ignorance is really mad, and the rhythm spelled out by the reality and reality in the editing is somewhat dotted. There are several high-angle shots, but I don't know what the photographer is for. The film expresses the intention to care for the mentally ill with good intentions. However, in terms of expression, I always feel that the emotional outburst is too sudden, and the editing is too abrupt in order to insert the rhythm. The most beneficial line: not everything can be outsourced to others.
