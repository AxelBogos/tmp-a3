My uncle played the role of the mister in All Things Fair. Here is still a kind-hearted adult who shares words with children. "Why don't you want me?" cried with the little hero. Fortunately, my uncle, Saga, and so many lovely people in the restaurant were all so kind to him. He is also a very kind child, always recording the dog cards that have been sent to space. But from his point of view, why get married and have children? Do you know how to make a living? Quarrels and fights are turned upside down, and it is self-inflicted to be killed. For women all over the world, do not commit crimes. Marriage alone can still be separated, and being planted is the life of the second half of a child.
