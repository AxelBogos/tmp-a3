I think without a bit of unbearable experience and a certain understanding of life beyond ordinary people, it is very difficult to make a story that is bought by the audience. Chris Evans is really not suitable for romantic films. It is not to say that his acting skills are unqualified and his whole aura and atmosphere are at odds with romantic films.
