Let me raise the score a little bit. The comments are full of unpredicted half-immortals, which is simply a deaf-mute version of Douban film review. This film is excellent, good actors, good jokes, good feelings, good BGM; in recent years, there are a lot of bad movies gathered by stars, and ferry people definitely stand out.
