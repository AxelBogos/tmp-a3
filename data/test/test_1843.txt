Old-fashioned and boring, none of the characters are cute, decent villains are all shrunken. It can be said that there is no bright spot. The same is a zombie film, Busan trip has a variety of emotional concerns, tension and suspense, a lovely fat uncle has a variety of characters with distinct personalities and progressive plots, this film really has nothing. Even Zhang Dongjian's rebellion and evil are not prominent, even Xuanbin's handsome are overshadowed. In the end, you have to be single and get into the protagonist's halo to shine.
