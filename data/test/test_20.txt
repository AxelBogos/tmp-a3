For people who love all kinds of movies, Quentin is simply a divine existence. He can always easily find a place to get to the point, and then you can't stop listening to his witty, absurd, nonsense stories. By the way, I would like to pay tribute to some old movies, because I resonate with him and secretly rejoice. This is the best disc store owner!
