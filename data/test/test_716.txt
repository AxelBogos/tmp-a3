Biyao is Zhang Xiaofan, the eldest lady of Ghost King Zong, and they are all respectable people anyway. The whole movie is like a gang wandering in the desert. In high school, I thought that Zhang Xiaofan was the top in my heart. Now this movie is really a mess from beginning to end, unable to complain. Besides, if you don't want me to think about the original fans, I just think this movie is ugly.
