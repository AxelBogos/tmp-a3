Just looking at this gray-and-white panoramic ink composition, color, and stage setting, it is worth the ticket price-- beautiful, full of classical texture like traditional Chinese painting. Photography and composition should be the biggest highlights of this film, and the story can be watched layer by layer, with a tight rhythm and interlocking, and the political struggle of the conspirators has been expressed in the old schemer's former work Hero. However, the thickness of the script adaptation is not enough, feel that the power is not enough, or the meaning is not enough, the ending is seriously inexplicable (you can say open-ended). And Deng Chao and Zheng Kai, seriously, the acting of this film is really amazing. Neither dark nor blown, Shadow is probably the best work of the national teacher in recent years. (three shots and the Great Wall are really not a thing) 7.8 @ Wanda Dolby Hall, Chengshan Road, Shanghai.
