Pretending to be a deep long shot, full of empty scenes full of boring plots, you just want to show the marital crisis, isn't it too self-expression in this way? Religious? You think the audience believes in the same religion as you? The director is not destined to become the general climate. For the general public, this film is boring and boring, and it is a bad film.
