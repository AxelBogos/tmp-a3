Less than two minutes of shootout was put into the trailer to promote it, which is definitely a foolish rhythm. I don't see any thrillers. I don't have the nerve to talk about comedy with such a low joke. It makes sense for you to classify it directly according to the feature film. If the weekend is really boring, if you want to go to the cinema to sleep and rest, it is recommended to see it.
