The Hitchcock color film, which continues the musical tension style of Hitchcock, the two-hour film makes people feel that the story is not compact enough, and later it is not exciting enough to solve the riddle. It may be more in line with the current appetite to deal with it in modern expressions. On the whole, the whole film is like an obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the repressive atmosphere is very consistent with what the film is trying to express.
