Some time ago, I saw that someone sorted out the King's script, which was extremely short, and Quentin's script must be extremely long. The commonness between Quentin and Woody Allen is to talk, but it is not enough to play tricks, but it is still not enough, even in terms of characters. But I love his personal hobbies, extremely emotional, take whatever he likes, extreme ego. In addition, PINK is a little pale and a little Bolton.
