Shimada's novel is adapted and starred by Hongye, which must be given five stars! Highly recommended! Just watch Hongye 😝 from beginning to end
This is the story of a talented detective who only listens to gossip and knows that there has been a homicide. This is a hero suitable for facial paralysis actors. I like the series of hand washing very much. Of course, I am talking about novels. It seems that this is the only movie that has been adapted into a movie. Who is going to adapt "Astrology" into a TV series? Aah!
