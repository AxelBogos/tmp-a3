Like Paradise lost, leading derailment to death without moral criticism is not to intimidate education, but a built-in driving force. If we don't know what loyalty means, what we need to give (including the possibility of unknown joy), and what we will get, don't talk about loyalty, and don't easily let yourself into a stable relationship, because you can't afford that responsibility. this is the protection of yourself and your partner.
