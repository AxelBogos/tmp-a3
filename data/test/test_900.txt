The idea of this film is actually very straightforward and simple. Ando Sakura acted really well. Finally, she cut off her short hair, she was beaten black and blue, and she finally got her wish and patted her opponent on the shoulder-finally she wanted more: she wanted to win. After reading it, I thought, want to get rid of their own self-pity, want to tell themselves to do everything well, then perhaps, my eyes will also emerge a strong desire for life â€¦
