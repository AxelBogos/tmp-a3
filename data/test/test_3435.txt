The beginning of the film is very hot in Tokyo. I thought it was a porn, but fortunately, the female ghost showed up to remind me that it was a horror film. The psychiatrist seemed to suggest that it was a psychological suspense drama, and the presentation of sisterhood once made me think it was a family ethics film. It wasn't until the basketball, wallet and dirt-eating plot appeared that I knew it was a fucking comedy! The worst in history, minus infinite points!
