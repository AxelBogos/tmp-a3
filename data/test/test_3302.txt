I haven't seen such an ugly film for a long time, the plot is full of loopholes and is illogical and inconsistent with historical facts. There is no bright spot except Xiao Jie Kun. Jay Kun acted so well that everyone who saw the film hated him. Every time the people in the movie are doing illogical things very seriously and soundtrack feels so great when they are released, I think everything is so funny.
