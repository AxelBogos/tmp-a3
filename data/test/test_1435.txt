The director is trying to make the pure Hollywood plot a little bit of violent aesthetics. Literary drama has a lot of upgraded scenes, accompanied by electronic psychedelic music; martial arts plays are very fast-paced and enjoyable. Although the film has a degree of relaxation, but also deliberately avoid some conventional scenes, but the overall feeling that the drama can be slightly cut.
