As soon as I saw that the scene was Japan, I had the feeling that this film wanted to be thundered. As a matter of fact, there is basically no suspense in the story. From the time Sarah saw the strange woman named Miao Kou, she could guess that the heroine was taking a stupid route. As a horror film with a good reputation on mc last year, the actual performance of this film is really disappointing. Next time, you'd better shoot honestly in Europe and America.
