I have no idea how to choose a cast. Apart from the fact that the male master and the eldest daughter are normal, how do the younger daughter, the eldest daughter's friend, the mother's friend think of the mentally retarded face? The story itself is also very strange, why look for an affair at a time like this. Originally, the process from unplugging the ventilator to death was a good subject, but it was a pity. I have no idea what Oscar and Golden Ball value him.
