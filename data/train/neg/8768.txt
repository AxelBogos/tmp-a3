Excuse me, where is the elegance of this aunt? Is it elegant to read a few books and eat a few chocolates? The whole film is full of fantasy and affectation, pretending to be hilarious. In particular, the assumption that Japan is full of mistakes and omissions is really hilarious. It is not clear that go was invented by China. The most awkward thing is that the Japanese invited his aunt to his house for dinner. He also said, "I don't know if you are familiar with Japanese food." as a result, he made Chinese dumplings! You're killing me!
