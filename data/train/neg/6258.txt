This TM is a bird. Twelve kids who want to die? It is clear that there are twelve children on an outing, while singing "Twelve dinosaurs went on a picnic, all set out in a tour bus, and sang happily on the road, Say I'm on my way". It turns out that the original work is still Chong Fangding, but it is normal to see that the director is Yukihiko Di, who was at his wit's end more than a decade ago.
