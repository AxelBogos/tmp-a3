Is it really bad, the story of Aladdin's lamp? The whole process of whitening the human-speaking Pokemon? There are a lot of immortals and beasts fighting indiscriminately, which is unreasonable at all, so there is no point in the direction of the supply, is it? Once saw the Pokemon theater version magnificent and moved, now it is not good-looking, piled up with immortals and beasts, completely do not know what to say.
