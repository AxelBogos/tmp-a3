I didn't see it until I saw the title of the film. I thought it was a good movie at first, but at the beginning I found it was really bad. The title of the film has been spoiled, and the Japanese and South Korean movies "my girlfriend is a robot" and India's A San's "Bollywood Robot Love" are simply not the same level. I sincerely hope that domestic films can also have a conscience.
