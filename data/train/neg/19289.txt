The rhythm is OK and the story is stable, but Eastwood's film has a big problem. He has a very strange understanding of the wide screen. He emphasizes the color contrast in the color, and the color of the picture is heavy and mainly cold. The lens is generally an incomplete mid-range close range, which makes the picture look very boring, as if naked telling others: I have no talent, this is a movie. Mystery River is this problem, and this film is also the same problem.
