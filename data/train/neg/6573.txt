Very boring poison soup. Put all the things that require hard work and qualifications to be obtained into a child's play, hanging all the way to good luck, the heroine is still an annoying ugly girl who forces beauty. Everyone is foolish, the rhythm is slow, the lens is not beautiful, the performance is grandiose, the lines are awkward, and I don't understand the meaning of this kind of film.
