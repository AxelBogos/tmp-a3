It's too boring, the whole boring adventure without waves and then keep making cold jokes, the performances of the two protagonists are not online at all, like an unfunny (female spy) with bad special effects. There is no scene that makes you feel nervous or stir you up. What is the age, and take a monster plus a two-minute black hole as the ultimate war? As soon as Remnison appeared on the stage, he wanted to tell you that he would eventually turn into a villain. Well, I think he fell asleep for several periods.
