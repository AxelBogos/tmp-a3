Love for the sake of love love movies, always can not accept the Reese Witherspoon, Patrick Dempsey is the reason why I keep watching it. In order to climb the tree, the woman tried hard to get rid of the skin of her "servant" and wanted to have a relationship with her childhood husband. I know that after a long journey, I am back to know that man and that Sweet Home, VS Alabama, city and village, gold and true love, for me, I will love?
