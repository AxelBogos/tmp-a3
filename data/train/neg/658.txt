Guan Hu's weak narrative ability is revealed in the killing, and he always has to rely on constant flashbacks to make the story barely make sense, but the random flashbacks make his story a disaster in the structure of the narrative, but killing people because of the depth of the theme is barely able to bear the theme of the film, and his poor narrative skills make it boring. It is very difficult for the audience to stay in the cinema for more than an hour.
