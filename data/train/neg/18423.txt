The film is regular, and the average value of Korean movies is not bad. But the concept of content is deducted by one star. Please put on your mask and come back to anti-science, set up the concept of independent women and talk about humanity. South Korea seems to have gone to the other extreme, the people will always be brilliant, and the rich in the government will always be ignorant and overcorrect.
