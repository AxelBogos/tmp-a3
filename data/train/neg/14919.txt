Suspense is not suspense. You can guess the story after watching it for more than 20 minutes. Although the process is cruel and realistic, the effect of the film is greatly reduced. Auntie acted well. It reveals the nature of most people who are willing to carry slavery and obey. Ask questions before doing anything, and second, don't infringe upon other people's human rights. 4.5
