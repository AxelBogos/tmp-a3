There are so many intentional scenes in the director that the film is too long. How can a successor who has been trained since childhood be so idealized, repressing emotions like a daughter's homosexuality and indulging too much, such as the outbreak of a babysitter when the hostess runs away from home? The snow begins in winter, the summer flowers end unexpectedly by the pool, and the shooting time is long enough.
