A real movie is a real spicy chicken. Did I watch a science fiction movie? A lot of things that don't make sense from beginning to end are totally anti-human? This China? Crime? Build a gun? Kill a cop for fifty thousand dollars? Heh! what's more, the acting skills of the actors puff into place from the beginning. It makes me want to throw up and find someone to give me a good comment? What do you say is so beautiful? Wow, I'm so angry. what's the end?
