Douban has a high rating for this film, but I don't quite understand it after watching it. If it is a person who doesn't like quiet narration, he may stop watching it after 20 minutes. The narrative of the film is peaceful and clear, but it doesn't appeal to me. It narrates a history of espionage in the past, but it falls far short of the ups and downs of the subject matter. Some people say that the highlight of this film lies in the waves rising in calm, but I think this is just the wishful thinking of domestic netizens.
