Hideaki Ueno has been obsessed with a psychoanalytical film about autistic children for so many years, but now that we are all grown up, the hero's mind is getting simpler and simpler. It took me three years to make such a nonsense film. I began to think that I was very lucky to see Eva and her daughter in high school.
