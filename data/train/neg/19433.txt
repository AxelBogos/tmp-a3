In the face of employees threatened by strikes, is it a sin for capitalists to be fired when they cannot agree? I think it is of low quality for customers to vent to waiters when they are in a bad mood. I think a man with a girlfriend cheating on another woman is at best immoral. I do not believe that the experience of the person seeking help without careful verification is negligence of duty; playing with other people's feelings and not getting married is a scumbag who plays hooligans. I don't think it's a sin. I can't use coincidences to throw the pot at the rich.
