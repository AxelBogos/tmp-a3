The protagonist of the second film has been changed, and at the beginning, he told everyone who the werewolf is. Werewolf 2 is actually quite obvious, and the female mate who can draw is still intelligent online. The little brother who bears the overall appearance is very sad when he gets it from the very beginning. And! Why didn't the villagers fight back? What will happen to the anti-murder?
