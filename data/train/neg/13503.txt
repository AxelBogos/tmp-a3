One point in soda dubbing. One point is given to the theme song "play with fireworks". When the movie sells meat, what is it that the hostess aims to be a bartender and doesn't want to have a real job? Is it possible that the two boys' timidity of unrequited love, as set throughout the movie, is youth under the illusion of nothingness? The face at the end of the first movie is also drunk, what is the round and flat fireworks from the side? Where did the glass ball come from?
