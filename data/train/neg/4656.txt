You can imagine with your toes that this is a bad movie. Ban the vulgar son of a bitch Yu Baimei!
Brother Chao, if you want to be funny, it doesn't matter. Because only in this way can we set off the beauty of the world.
If you want to do comedy, it doesn't matter. Because it's the only way to make us more happy.
If you want to be a runner, it doesn't matter. Because in this way we can see the meaning of running.
But, Brother Chao, if only vulgarity is your skill. Or is it true that you look back?
