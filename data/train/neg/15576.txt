If it hadn't been for Tsai Ming-Liang, I wouldn't have gone to see the movie at all, and after watching it, I wasn't sure whether the plot of the movie was consistent with what I thought. Procrastination and encumbrance are the criticism of this film, the play that can be finished in one minute lasts for 10 minutes, and the performance of the actors can not well reflect their inner activities. Of course, there are many ways to express desire, which can be procrastinating and intense, and making a film depends entirely on the style of the director.
