Accompany a best friend to see Zheng Kai, at the beginning almost thought that she asked me to see a small movie. As a result, this film you say that it is also vulgar is not in place, but also not as good as the so-called network self-made drama, dog blood hypocrisy together. I just complain about the plot. can this be regarded as true love? I'm very sleepy. The actor is OK, Jiang Yiyan's face is also enough, but I still look back and watch a few episodes of running man to save Zheng Kai's image in mind.
