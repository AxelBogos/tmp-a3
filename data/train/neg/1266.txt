The rhythm is too slow and boring, and the lines are long and boring. To a reasonable extent, why didn't the hostess realize that the neighbor was an aunt and the teacher had been dead for a long time?

The island's scary island setting is much more ingenious. Anyway, it can't be compared with the island at all.
