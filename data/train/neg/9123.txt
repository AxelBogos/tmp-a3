I went to the cinema about a few weeks ago. I couldn't stand the plot at that time.

Perhaps Douban nurtured for a long time, not literature and art is not called a movie, anyway, I was sick before I finished watching it. There was no plot, no music, no emotional lines, all rubbish accumulated by computer software. I'm looking forward to it soon. I can't stand the endless thrill of special effects.
After seeing the foreshadowing of the sequel, I laughed to myself, cao, so stupid.
