The script is too bad and the behavior of the characters is illogical. Olga high heels plus one star. Agent 007 is old, hand-to-hand combat is over, can only hold a small pistol biubiu. There is nothing new, that is, the basic spy movies, the plot, mission combination is not good enough, relatively chaotic. I think the purpose of Brosnan's coming out of the mountain is to show, "look, I'm still so handsome when I lose weight, and I can hook up with girls who can hook up with the new 007s."
