This movie is 6.5? Is it the water army of Huayi? The whole story is old-fashioned and boring, the character's Facebook plot is childish, and it starts and ends hastily, and the 100 minutes really doesn't say anything. I don't know if the movie is stupid, or these mothers in the United States are so stupid that they completely copy the way of youth movies. And the fact that the hostess fell in love with the widower is a high-end black to her 20-year-old child? It's a bottle of feminist poison.
