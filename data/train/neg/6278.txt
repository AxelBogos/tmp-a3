This is the worst movie I have ever seen. No, it should be the worst movie ever. Rotting out the work of Xintiandi! The plot can not help but water, the relationship between the characters is also inexplicably pulled into the relationship! And the last mysterious thing, what is it? A little joke about Cupid? Fuck the plot! If you can, I really want to get a zero!
