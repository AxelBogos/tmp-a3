Oh, I haven't seen such a stupid movie for a long time. The rhythm was so kuso that the hero hung up as soon as I came up. I was confused. The general plasma film routine is that the male master lives to the end and sacrifices organ transplants for the female master, regardless of whether they match or not. The dirty hands casually grab it, and in the last half of the time, they talk about the female master fighting back. This review is also quite funny. The hostess was very sorry about how high the starting point of American beauty was.
