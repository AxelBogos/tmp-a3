I didn't like Japanese fantasy in the first place. I put up with it for Jun Inoue. I didn't expect it or I couldn't help it. It is also the kind that has made a lot of settings that are completely useless and unnecessary, such as being asked by the author with a knife to see whether my world outlook is grand or not. Okay, you're big, so you spend most of your time letting the character do things that don't need these settings at all? The film is basically driven by settings, the character can not stand up like paper, each crying scene is too stiff to empathize, and even aggravates the dislike of the character. It's a pity that Jun Inoue painted on horseback. Looking back on the paragraph of Jun Inoue in Jinmin's works, I suddenly feel that painting is not a bonus for the director, but for the director.
