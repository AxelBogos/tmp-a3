Except for the wonderful part of the car chase at the beginning of the film, the other contents are really mediocre and have no bright spots. This John is so stupid and numb that he chose the actor. Because this time the villain is a woman, so Schwarzenegger can not bear to fight, so the fight is not exciting?
