After watching # FIFF1# late at night, I'm sure its hardware is complete, but this kind of love movie is not to my taste, it's not that the movie is not good enough, it's just a difference in taste. Young Winona is at the peak of her beauty, and young Bell does not need to lose weight crazily to show her professionalism. Young Dunst already has some aura of the future Cannes film queen, and even Aunt Su San, "the crazy flower at the end", retains one or two points of youthful charm. Youth is really good. I admire youth.
