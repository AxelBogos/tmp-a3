After watching the first two episodes, I have my own problem. I really don't like the fact that people from Britain, the United States, France, the United States, Japan and Russia all speak Chinese in the play, which is not available under the historical conditions at that time. At least be serious. How about a little bit of professionalism like "kite"? They are all made in China, and the time gap is not long.
