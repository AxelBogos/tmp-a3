There are major problems with the performance of 2013.6.27.10:15am actors (incorrect rhythm of dialogue), narrative (no basic presentation) and lens (slow shot, misuse of tilt composition). Basically, it can be said that it is a brief introduction to the novel with pictures, and only a long mirror in the show has a cinematic sense. The jumping at the end was not bad. Since this kind of film provides a wide space for complaint and symptom analysis, add one star to two stars.
