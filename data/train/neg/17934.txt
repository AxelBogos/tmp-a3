I often say that the wonderful tale of the world died at least seven or eight years ago, but every time I went to see it cheaply, I was really addicted to self-abuse. Even if you add Tezuka's original pest control work, even if you add Mr.Children and back number two classic love songs, you still can't watch them. As far as Zhongshan Miho and Asahi Yosuke are concerned, they try so hard not to score the lowest score for singing rap (though badly).
