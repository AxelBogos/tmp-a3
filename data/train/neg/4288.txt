Finally saw the film history of the bad film, I think we should admit that this film is extremely bad in all aspects, but lovely rotten, rotten so that people can not be angry. Compared with the film "dangerous situation in a different Space", it is so sincere that you can almost see the director's foolish sincerity and enthusiasm behind the baffling lines, ridiculous scenes and props, and the cute plot. Unlike the perfunctory and slandering of the audience's IQ by bad films like those in China.
