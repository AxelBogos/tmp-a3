Although I know I will be very tangled, but still can not help but go to see this fake blockbuster, alas. Sure enough, why should this 4 be filmed into two parts? At this point of the plot, the last episode can basically be cut out of the content of 2 / 2 / 3. Every time I see the two leading actors and actresses look at each other without focus with that kind of depressed, tangled, bitter expressions, I want to fast-forward.
