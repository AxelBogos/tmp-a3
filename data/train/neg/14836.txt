The level of horror film is very general, and the score of Douban is very high. The plot is easy to understand and it is not brain-burning at all, and the reversal at the end is not enough. Looking at the three stories separately, they are all very mediocre, and connecting them into a whole is just a small suspense story in which the details win, not to mention that the structure of the story is not special.
