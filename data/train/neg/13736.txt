When I read the profile of sin house, I suddenly remembered that I had seen the powerful Hong Kong film script, which gave me a lot of surprises, but apart from Louis Koo, the acting skills of the actors were mediocre and few mainland actors had a sense of helplessness that they didn't know what to use to catch the eye. In addition, the Donnie yen made by CG is too bad to complain.
