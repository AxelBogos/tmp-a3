It might be more appropriate to show it in a stage play, where there is no interlocking reasoning, and the detective is more like a perspective that leads the audience into the plot, but some omniscient perspectives somewhat destroy closeness. The case is relatively simple, and what I want to express does not lie in this. The dramatic performance of the actors overshadows the plot, and the whole is more mediocre.
