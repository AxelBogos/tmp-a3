Please look at the officers and recall the development of the plot after the hero fell in love at first sight. After being forced to compromise by force, the heroine is still tough (tough). It is not consistent with the performance of normal people in the face of incurable illness and forced compromise. After that, the dispute between the heroine and the hero at work could have been fine (even if she took so many accounts, she didn't see the people waiting around to show that there were few people).
