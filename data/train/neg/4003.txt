Please don't borrow the names of Sherlock Holmes and Watson. If you want to shoot, say Detective An and Assistant B. this reset is simply blasphemous to the novel. Maybe I am no longer young to accept such an ambiguous plot and clown Sherlock Holmes. There is a limit to pretending to be a prodigal son and a good friend. Don't think that the whole world is a rotten girl. After watching the last scene in 2011, I was disappointed and angry.
