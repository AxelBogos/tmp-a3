After watching "Shadow" with his wife, I slipped into the "Fatty Action team" next door to get ready for a free movie. I apologized to the cinema here, but the movie was so bad that I couldn't stand it and went home in the middle of it. the movie was so bad that the good mood of the two people who had been immersed in the "film" on the way home was ruined by this half of the free movie.
