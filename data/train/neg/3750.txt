Boring, boring, not what I expected. At first I thought it was a film with a rhythm and style similar to Leonardo's "the Flying Man". The picture of this movie is old, and I thought it was downloaded wrong, like the picture from the 1980s. It's really like a current account, and the plot is not very attractive. After watching it for a few minutes, I don't want to see it.
