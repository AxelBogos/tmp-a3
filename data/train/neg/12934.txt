The quality of three-and-a-half stars is deducted because the story is too primary-age, and another star is because of dubbing. In fact, most of the domestic star dubbing is miserable, so it is better to pay less than full-time dubbing like the little prince. In addition, add half a star to the original, after all, it is rare to have domestic animated films with pure original scripts these days! Finally, I would like to complain about why the Jade Emperor has a Hong Kong and Taiwan accent.
