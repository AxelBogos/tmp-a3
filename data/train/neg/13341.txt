It's not his problem. I really hate ghost movies or something. In the previous summer article, Xiangjing Li and saki were itching to death, but they held back because it was horrible. When I saw Miura and Mizugawa this time, I couldn't help but be cheap. As a result, after reading a little more short story, I decisively turned it off and deleted it. To watch Japanese TV dramas or to be warm, inspirational and laughing is the right way!
