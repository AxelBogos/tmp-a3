The capitalist countries in Europe seem to be the biggest protagonists in this film. Paul's every move is related to them. They are Paul's saviors, the people they sent are very kind, they are even kinder than Paul, they protect the interests of the local people, and even sacrifice their own lives! Use all the resources at your disposal! Righteous, kind, strong! That's how they made me feel in this movie. It seems to interfere with him for them.
