Can you believe the May movie? my expectations for this movie are at the forefront. However, if the ticket price of the movie is not cabbage, I will not come to see it. The ticket price of 7 yuan is absolutely worthy of my wish to see Zhao Wenzhuo. By the way, Wanqian's little hammering circle is also cute. The editing is too chaotic, the narrative is not smooth, and the characters, especially Qi Jiguang's portrayal is basically nothing. After reading it, there should be a lot of people who feel that Qi Jiguang's army really wins because of luck.
