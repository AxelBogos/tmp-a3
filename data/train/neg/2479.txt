My friends all said that it was a bad movie or gave up their lives to accompany a gentleman to accompany others to see it, and it was unexpectedly bad. The story is neither new nor sincere, and every story is boring, not to mention the tone of the last environmental protection promotional film. All the actors have fallen, and even Ge You, who can always support the scene, is so disappointing this time. PS. And why are all the actors talking in such a tone that they miss Party An and Party B?
