It was only when I turned the ticket stub that I found that I almost missed this piece. The strangest movie experience ever seen in the cinema, not to mention that the picture is dark, the characters are pitifully few, and the plot is boring and rotten. Without subtitles, the whole film is deleted from beginning to end for only a little more than an hour, and it suddenly comes to an end. The audience at the end of the show is completely dumbfounded. It's lucky that the cinema didn't get a refund.
