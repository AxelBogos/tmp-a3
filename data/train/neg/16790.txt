I knew it was a bad movie but I went to the cinema because I was bored. There is only a general impression of the plot. I remember most clearly that Jason Stanson looked handsome in a baseball cap. I loved you even if you were a boring film critic-I had no feelings for Lan Lan. Is it true that Grandpa Stallone can't go home for his old age? I look distressed. Don't bother.
