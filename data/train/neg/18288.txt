This is a film made in Japan, invested by South Korea, and somewhat like a Thai scenery film, but the plot trend is the tone of "Lover". Because Zhongshan Miho, who made a comeback ten years later, is worth it anyway. (people must always be ready to say goodbye / better understand / loneliness is one of the friends who are least likely to betray)
