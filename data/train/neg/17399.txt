I thought it would be a vigorous style, but I didn't expect it to be so weak. Director Dou also starred in Wang Tong's "Banana Paradise", but his grasp of the same theme was much smaller. The actor played by Ruan Jingtian always looks like a bystander, which is not as good as Chen Jianbin. Of course, his acting skills also have something to do with it, and he always owes something in the restoration of his sense of age.
