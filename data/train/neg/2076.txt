I haven't seen such a bad video for a long time, which is worse than the classroom homework shot by many of my classmates. It is very inexplicable. No one's speech and behavior is normal, and the plot is bluntly like cheap plastic. One star, to the big banyan tree and walking road by the Pearl River. It's not a good shot either.
