Quentin was hacked the worst time. The plot and structure are a combination of the old helpless and the vulgar novel, the lens has hardly changed, and the only stretch is the subjective scene after the hotel waiter enters the room. The film is not only the background of ppt and flash, the director touched the bottom line of my understanding of the film, deliberately skipping action with editing and close-ups is a chicken ah? The front lens is too fucking stiff.
