Before I went, I only saw high marks and did not pay attention to the film reviews. When I came back, I saw that so many people said that they were moved to tears. The premise of the story between yin and yang is very distasteful. A big flying cat is the ugliest plug-in I've ever seen. In the end, I don't know if it's about family or dreams. Two or three generations of the family do not support or understand that you still want to be reunited in the end. I would rather dink than force remember me many times.
