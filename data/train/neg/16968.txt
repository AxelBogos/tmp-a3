This is a screenwriter who really doesn't know how to write it down. At least after watching the first and second film, we know that their transition from singing traditional songs to pop from focusing too much on stage performance to singing original is very complicated. As a matter of fact, the arrangement of this film is mediocre.
But at the beginning, it is still customary for drama Anna to sing as beautiful as ever!
