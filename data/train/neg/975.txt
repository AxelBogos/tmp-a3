I am definitely a brain-damaged fan of the Mingyue series in the Qin Dynasty, and I have been following since the level of the first hair or a handful of cakes. But yes, I'll play one star! First of all, those mentally handicapped fans, do you really want to become stupid yourself? Be a little rational, okay? Can you score 7 points for this?! The plot gives me goose bumps. And Shaoyu, what do you mean? If you want to change your mind or something, look how calm he is in the morning! Where do I put my magnolia?
