Beauty is all in form, art, music, body appearance, and further creation in audio-visual language is not seen. The editing echoes with the play, but there is no internal motivation. A woman who no longer believes in art is suddenly frightened by a novel. A wife who was being cheated suddenly rekindled her enthusiasm for her vanished ex-husband. These plots and emotions are so lacking in groundwork and thinking that they make the characters seem unsympathetic.
