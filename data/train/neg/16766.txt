The word long is about you. Blind Matthew's usual exquisite and inexplicable acting. All I can say is, the relationship part was a good shot. But what is the point of this piece? What are you trying to say about discrimination against blacks? Black and white intermarriage? Civil War? I didn't tell you anything. The editor does as he pleases, and the lines of the father and son cross each other, and they have to rely on subtitles to indicate the main points. So where is the center of this film?
