Before I went to sleep, I actually watched a movie with so many bugs, but it was a pity for the acting skills of the male and female actors. At first, I thought it was the first love for 50 times, but it became a suspense film in the middle, and the end was so hasty to coax the audience that I really wanted to sleep.
