I have seen the original + remake, aesthetic fatigue. Since it is beginning, it is better to shoot more (or fictional) some experiences and misdeeds of Hewitt's childhood + adolescence. The first birth shoot is good, and then it must be more interesting. You see, even the character composition is similar to the previous two films, why bother â€¦
