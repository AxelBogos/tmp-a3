When I saw the sea, I guessed the type of film, the title and the score of the film. I guessed that an one-star film ended up. I dared to shoot it, but I didn't know how to shoot it. It wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. What I would like to see is reflection and sophisticated and complicated internalization, which is lacking, but no effort has been made. However, from the point of view of "those who are beyond the scope of their work," it is still necessary to attack the direction of "those who do not live", and it is also a generational normality, but the "ability and ability" must be based on their own commitment and ability and the courage to bear the consequences, otherwise this is bullshit.
