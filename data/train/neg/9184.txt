One thing that Indian movies have in common with Zhao Benshan's Xiao Shenyang is that they are very self-righteous in peddling the essence of their minds. The former is Indian song and dance, while the latter is Errenzhuan in the northeast. Their problem is that they can't figure out that these things with national quintessence or regional essence are actually only a little bit of quintessence, and most of them are still rubbish in the process of hardening, for those of us who do not have the same sense of regional pride as they do. Really suffer.
