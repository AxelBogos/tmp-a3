I feel like I'm watching Batman join hands with transvestite Robin to fight a disguised geek and a double-faced man who kills Matt. All the villains are like psychopaths, the characterization is not three-dimensional enough, and even if Harvey and the Riddler switch, I feel the same. By the way, Nicole Kidman is really flipping.
