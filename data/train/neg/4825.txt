Understand one truth: as long as the script is bad enough, even if the goddess has stripped off so many times, there is no interest in it; it is estimated that only people who have read the novel can understand the movie. Amar'e Stoudemire is not worth taking off for such a play, and his figure is really bad. It's better to wear leather pants.
