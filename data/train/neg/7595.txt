There are too many irrelevant nonsense jokes, inexplicable slow motion (especially in the shootout), negative IQ of all characters (except Zhong Hanliang), no suspense, slow plot, and the actor's poor performance. In particular, Zhao Wei's role, I hate the most role, a no distinction between right and wrong, no ability, foresight, judgment, encountered setbacks on hysteria, was sold for the number of money, a complete idiot.
