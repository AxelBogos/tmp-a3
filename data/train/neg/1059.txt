Start with a bunch of BUG. First, the hostess's girlfriend knew full well that there was a chase behind her, but she was hard of hearing and could not hear and knocked on the door, afraid she was not a fool. Since the hostess can't hear you knocking at the door, can you just break the glass or go somewhere else? Just waiting to die at the door? I believe that any woman with a normal IQ in China will directly kick the glass, go in and look for tools to fight back, or call the police while avoiding obstacles. Third, the killer has many opportunities to kill the hostess, ah, I am stupid, I will not kill, I will let her kill back? Come on, screenwriter, tell me how this fool killed his girlfriend. Isn't he funny? Are you sure he's not funny?
