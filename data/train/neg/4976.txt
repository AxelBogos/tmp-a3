Sisters and sisters. The movie fell asleep, just like the theme, I saw the 60-frame version, and the trace of the performance is too obvious, which means that it is fake at first, and the individual thinks that if the casting fails, if you watch the 24-frame version, you may not be able to wait for the Blu-ray to come out, and then look at the 24-frame version and then grade it.
