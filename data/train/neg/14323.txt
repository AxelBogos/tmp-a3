It takes more space to achieve the satire of the original work. The fatal wound of this film is that if filmed according to a panoramic film, it will not be able to show the sparks and hearts of the characters when they confront each other, lack of emotional atmosphere, and are more likely to be torn apart like a donkey. The dark performance of more characters makes the film stay at the social and cultural film level of hatred, rather than the literary system or psychological system. Not to mention bad photography and character matting.
