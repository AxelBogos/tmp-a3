It's another series of "cops other than protagonists are so stupid". The actor's acting skill depends on gnashing his teeth and shouting, and the second case comes entirely from criminal psychology. The bug that travels through time is huge. I don't understand why the rating is so high. Bye-bye. No more chasing.
