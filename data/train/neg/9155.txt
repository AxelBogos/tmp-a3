The action director is the unknown "Zhang Peng" (forgive me for being ill-informed), but the actual completion is good. In terms of literature and drama, it is still a piece of shit, which is a pity, because you can see that the director, Wuzhi, and editing have done their job solidly, and as a result, they have all been fucked to death by the screenwriters.
