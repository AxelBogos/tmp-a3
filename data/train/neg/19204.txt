It's a good idea, but it's too fake to be a good old man, or if a brother dies, he can be easily forgiven for being killed. In the end, the two sons died, leaving the old mother alone. I don't know what to be proud of. I feel that the whole movie is extraordinarily verbose. I'm sorry to fast-forward, but I didn't cry.
