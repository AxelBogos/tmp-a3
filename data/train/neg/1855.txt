Scissors, crack, rot black, long trench coat and mask: the concept is full but the finished product is disappointed: this film and television adaptation is completely sorry to Kanako Kanako's original work. I heard that it is still a trilogy, with a textual research on the content and source of the Legend 2 of Rift Girl. But this is not satisfied with this film, looked at the crack 0 and copied the poster of the rose red lotus, I am not interested in seeing it again.
