There are three dissatisfaction: 1. The sex between the shapeshifter and Magneto is a little baffling (because of Magneto's "be yourself bravely"?). From some memories of X-Men 3, we can see that Professor X and Magneto partnered to visit young mutants when they were old. It can be seen that the fall-out was later. So it doesn't make sense at the end of the first war (when the two go their separate ways). 3. A bunch of film reviews are all about gay, damn it!
