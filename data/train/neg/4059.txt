Drug addicts (a star second generation) bring the dog, please. What is the theme of this movie that makes drug addicts invisible? Don't tell me the movie is good. Just leave some actor alone. That's not what you said when Ke Zhendong played a policeman. And the movie may not be that good. Besides, is Jackie Chan deceiving the audience by concealing his son's participation in the show? (it has nothing to do with moral kidnapping, it's up to you, just express your opinions, fans don't trust me any more.)
