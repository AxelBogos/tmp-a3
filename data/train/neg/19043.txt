It is completely a 2-hour extended sp level, in addition to composition and photography, other aspects are simply the scene of a large-scale disaster. The arrangement of the group play is general, the branch line is in a mess, the rhythm is warm and swallow like water, and the reasoning is drowsy, so many plots are useless and there is no need to drag on so long. Only Cass is really luxurious, and you can see a familiar face every few minutes on average. Matsuko's acting skills are really superb. If only the director had put more effort into makeup, it would be too easy to recognize.
