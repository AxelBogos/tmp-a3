The director's narrative is weak, countless details fail, and he pays no attention to logic. Want to shoot black humor, but will only pull the moral of the scene mechanically, incoherent. The film has many corners and high facial recognition, that is, the story is so tangled that it is unexpectedly awarded by the organizing committee of the University Film Festival. Is a good film dead?
