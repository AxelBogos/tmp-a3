I think I can say bluntly that this is the worst mainstream commercial film I have ever seen, fragmented to fragmented from narrative to editing, disdaining to tell a complete story or showing a complete scene. Almost none of the parts of the film were successful, and David Yates once again masked his lack of talent with visual effects all over the screen. Zero.
