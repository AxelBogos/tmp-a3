Weird movie. The living standard of the hostess doesn't look like she needs manual labor to make a living. Will aunt Yu be too calm, fall in love and make a comeback (the man suddenly wanted to be her agent and she just accepted it?! ), there seems to be no emotional ups and downs. The person is very beautiful, and the natural sense of being a young girl in her sixties is also kneeling. In addition, why do all my favorite actors sing poorly and like to sing very much?
