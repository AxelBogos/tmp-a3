Rubbish! It doesn't look good at all. Even if it's such a bad movie, it can get 8 points? Do you have to give 8 points to those who resist Japan? Is it true that people who give 8 points have been poisoned by hand-tearing devils for so long that even movies that are generally not good-looking can get high marks? This movie can only get 5.7 points at most! The award must have been bought by some people who spent a lot of money. Only Schindler list shoes!
