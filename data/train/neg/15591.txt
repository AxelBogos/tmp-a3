Can't appreciate it, emmmmm.
It's an exaggeration. It's not good.
I would like to know what kind of environment the director was born in. The rural area where I grew up is a remote area of only one college student, where sex is taboo. If it is not based on the adaptation of real experience, then why can he make an aimless guess about the backward sexual culture in China's rural areas?
