3.1x10 Dharma Shark acting Hold! Personally, I really don't like the way of chopping off all the groundwork and speaking directly from the middle, not to mention that the whole film has not made a good supplement to this missing part. Family affection, love, and even social behavior all dabble in; but getting involved in everything ends up leaving no impression on any part of it. Watching a car chase is not a High, and a lot of conversation consumes patience. It was really excruciating.
