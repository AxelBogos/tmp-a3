# the story of youth written in the 1980s # and # looks like the story of youth written in the 1980s # there is really a big difference between the plot "in order to help sick students resolutely donate the money they finally earned". I think the post-80s and post-90s writers can't write it anyway. It really feels like the plot that only appears in "Don't cry at the age of 17" and "Flower and Rainy season". Too much of the tears of the times. Originally, the comedy part in front of me was all right, but at the end, I was suddenly forced into a car accident and forced to stir up emotion. I felt that it was also a technique of the eighties and nineties. How can tear gas films sell so well these days? do contemporary people still have to sit in the cinema before they can cry?
