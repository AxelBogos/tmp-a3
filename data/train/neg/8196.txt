Everything has two sides, and the Soviet Union's correct control over socialist politics in ideology in the film is really disgusting. but the West's use of various media (radio, newspapers, etc.) to incite a class of students to engage in political activities is even more scary, not to mention the fact that these students are still immature. It is better to watch less of this kind of film with serious political orientation.
