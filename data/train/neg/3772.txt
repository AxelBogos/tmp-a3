The film is totally out of line with reality. If the child said that he had been sexually assaulted, he should go to the hospital immediately for examination. After the examination, it is easy to judge whether it is true or false. Such a serious accusation feels that it has not gone through the legal process, but it has always been formidable, and it cannot happen in reality. Moreover, Lucas is the best friend of the heroine's father. Doesn't he understand the character of his friend? as a father, he should know more about his daughter's character. The plot is too far-fetched.
