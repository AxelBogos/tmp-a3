It's a really bad movie. Before looking at it, it was said that a girl would be chased by the killer, and then ran and fell. And then there is! It's all a laugh. I died too early and complained too much. The lady friend fell in love with the killer as soon as she was killed. But what about the sense of superiority after watching the super bad movie?!
