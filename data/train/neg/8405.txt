Let's not talk about how bad the film is purely from a film point of view. I just want to say, why do Chinese people make this movie?! There is a bitter feud between the Mongols and the Chinese! You will only hate Japan and scold Japan! Do you know that what the Mongols did to China is hundreds of times worse than that of Japan? Japan just invaded Mongolia and destroyed China! If it were not for Mongolia, it would not be as tragic as the modern history of China and as poor as it is today!
