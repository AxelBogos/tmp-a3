Two stars give animation technology and effects. I still have something to say about such a movie that makes me fall asleep directly: 1. Should cartoon characters be set like this? Corrugated edges and corners, silly all kinds of avatars can only deceive ignorant children and make them quarrel with their parents to buy the perimeter. Should the story be childish and then tend to be mentally retarded? 3. I don't like the appearance of spinach, that kind of behavior is not my mischief, but self-righteous behavior.
