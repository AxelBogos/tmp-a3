The theme song is purely inserted, how to listen and how to look at that part is all MV for MV. The story is lame. People are extremely ordinary, only monkeys have a bit of style. Mapping and modeling are much better than before, and some scenes are fine, and the special effects are just like that (about the same level as the normal level of domestic TV movies), and the polishing still needs polishing. The most annoying thing is that all kinds of lines jump logic to play. People who don't have a literary mind will be really miserable in screenplays. I mean, the works will be miserable.
