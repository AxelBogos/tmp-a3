"Escape of the Jedi", "Railway Flying Tiger" and "Kung Fu Yoga" on the first day of the Lunar New year, Jackie Chan in 2016 is a bit prolific. This piece is really burning Jackie Chan's heart, by the way, I want to edify my son who has a bad deed, and it is also a pity for the hearts of parents all over the world. The film is cut into paragraphs, and some of them have no effect on advancing the plot, purely for the sake of funny passages that look silly. In the end, the best part of the train didn't stand out.
