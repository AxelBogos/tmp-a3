To tell you the truth, I don't really believe that this is Chen Guo's film, even if it can't be a classic, but it's not so substandard. One star for Hao Lei, Pan Hong, music bar, baby do whatever you have to do, I beg you. And finally pay tribute to the dead star is several meanings, there is no get to the point of this film.
