The director because of the previous "escape from desperate town" fire. I thought I was a little talented, but after watching this movie, I felt very mediocre. To tell you the truth, is Douban really attracted to such a horror movie? To be honest, it's really average. His recent production of "Yin and Yang Devil World" is also boring, and now I do miss the plasma tablets of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.
