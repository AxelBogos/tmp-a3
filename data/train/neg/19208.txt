Because the movie version is not good, audio and video do not correspond to each other, so I jump to watch it. When I hear poetry on and off, it's hard to say whether it's good or bad-not to mention the pure lyrical expression of emotion without background, so I don't like this ignorant film. But the shooting and dubbing, including the interlude of poetry, are interesting. Even though this kind of "interesting" is called a milestone of Chinese film. What kind of movies can be made according to this mode?
