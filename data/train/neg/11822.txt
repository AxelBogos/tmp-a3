Just take a look at it, death note + the feeling of Iron Man. The life of the kennel at the beginning of the film is moving. I didn't expect it to be a comedy, not a real drama, and the joke was caught off guard. And the whole audience exclaimed after taking off the sugar. It was so beautiful. The scenery of Shinjuku is too familiar.
