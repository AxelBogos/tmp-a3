I don't like it. It doesn't feel like a novel. Humbert's tone of voice in the original works always makes me feel that he has a kind of English arrogance, so I guess he is also the kind of European gentleman who is a little skinny. However, the male lead does not quite match. A star gives ingenious erotic expression, a star gives the man the last cry.
