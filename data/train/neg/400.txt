What a mess! mere trash! The characters are all withered and have no meaning, the plot is like dog blood, the actors are uglier than the other, and the songs and dances are not outstanding. And the teenagers in this film are rebellious, parents set to suppress their nature, want to become famous does not need to bear hardships, talk to love, will quarrel with their parents, talk back to the teacher, can be famous all over the world. The director and screenwriter thought the audience was an idiot.
