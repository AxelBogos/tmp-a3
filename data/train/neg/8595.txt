It took almost two strokes and three minutes to go to the grave, and then became close to science in a second. This Laura is simply stupid and self-willed and selfish, with low combat effectiveness and looking for trouble. She can sacrifice the world to save her father. In the end, she can run to draw a ladder and die with the villains. There are too many procrastinating and useless plots and inexplicable fighting scenes in the whole movie. Daniel Wu is a real passer-by.
