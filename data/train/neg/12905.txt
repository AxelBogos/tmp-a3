1.5 stars. I forgot to comment on it. When commenting on the Great Buddha, I think about the one-sided analysis of the conventional labels of film ideas and film reviews, and think of the negative examples of Indian films, which are more representative of "my God" and this "wrestling". Do not like Indian movies, have balls. Good, but not good enough. The feeling is good at first glance, but the idea is simple and there is no aftertaste. It's actually very rubbish. Indian singing and dancing and laughing also fail. No, not really.
