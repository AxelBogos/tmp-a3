This doctor-patient relationship movie, which used to play at least four stars, made it impossible for me to look directly at the director's brilliant ending, as if the girl told you to stop as soon as the best part. Orlando Bloom's exquisite and skilful acting skills, coupled with emotional montage, his noble bangs can really kill you. Only this empty and boring bad ending, such a good plot thriller should be defeated in such a situation, it is a pity.
