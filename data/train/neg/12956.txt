When I saw the news of the Arts Federation, I felt that this piece had been abandoned. I also knew that the picture did not perform well when I saw the notice. But I didn't think it could break the lower limit. The Beijing article does not need the dialogue narrative, the whole process does not know the meaning QQ signature style pain youth narration, the content is extremely empty. The last two articles are getting better and better, but they are still monotonous and extremely current. Dubbing is awkward enough. Cantonese is not what normal people say, regardless of lines or tone. Director Li's performance is a bit interesting.
