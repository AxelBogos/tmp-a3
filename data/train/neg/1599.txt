1, the protagonist looks like Kenichi Matsuyama
2. Hypnosis is fake (the hypnotist is unprofessional and the hypnotized person will not be so excited when he or she wakes up)
3. The film doesn't know what it means, and even looks ridiculous to me, and there are contradictions in some places.
4, not a good story
5. The characters in it are not vivid.
