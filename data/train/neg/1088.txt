The only thing to see is those girls. Bruce Lee is not only a crappy actor, but even more unclassy when Wu Zhi. As soon as he shoots his hand and raises his legs, his opponent is out of his ass, and there is no confrontation at all, that is, dragon sets and BOSS are queued up to be beaten, the same routine as domestic anti-Japanese dramas. No wonder the audience has such a high degree of overlap.
