I think it should be very good, but many passers-by are belittled. I am now angry and determined to swallow the sun and the moon. I just don't get a good opportunity. Obama in the film is so ugly. Now I don't like people who are secretly against me. I don't like people whispering with me now. I like to speak bluntly. My grandfather, an old thief, should not live long. He is a born punk. I know there are a lot of people who are secretly dissatisfied with me now, but what can they do to me?
