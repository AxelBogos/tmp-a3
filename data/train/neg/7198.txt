WHAT A MESSY AND UNNECESSARY PIECE OF SHIT. And to the one certain filmmaker I watch this for: Quit now. You are so much better than this. Write a few more sentences in 2018: looking back on the two years after its release, I was still very proud of Ayer, which had nothing to do with the quality of the movie, mainly because of his own posture and gains. His handling of the negative things of the film, the failure of the film, the behind-the-scenes drama, is so sincere and mature acceptance, and learned a lot from it, whether it is filmmaking craft or getting along with studio/fans. I think no matter what the relationship with the Studio is later, in my opinion, this time he is walked away with grace. The heroine of the white lotus in the universe died of the whole family, ha.
