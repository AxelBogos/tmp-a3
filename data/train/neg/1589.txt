This script really doesn't work. I find that even the three East Asian countries can't make disease films. They are obviously a nation of emotional restraint, but they can't handle it well. This film is even more problematic. Even if the footage is broken completely and then combined at random, the director treats it like a concentrated soap opera with no dignity as a film. Premature ejaculation is the funniest thing about teenagers. When typing, the hands and body are definitely the double springs of the little man dance.
