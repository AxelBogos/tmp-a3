Deliberately sell badly, feel awkward every second, let me more and more sure of one thing: if Lao Ta tests the upper limit of the film, von Tier sometimes tests the lower limit of the film. This may be overturned in the future. We cannot deny the height and depth of some of von Tier's works, but we also have to admit that there are some grotesque and deformed works, just like this film has been in existence for nearly 1/5 centuries, and many people still can't like it.
