Jump to see, too miserable, as a father with a daughter, can not look directly. The movie is either miserable or okay. After reading it, I felt miserable, but I didn't feel particularly shocked. As a movie, it is very ordinary, but it is a very miserable movie with a campus theme. It is not recommended very much, and the women in it are not beautiful.
