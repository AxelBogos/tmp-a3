This film should thank Wei Nan for cutting the trailer so beautifully and editing all the action scenes quickly, which makes people look forward to it, but at the same time, after watching the feature film, the disappointment will be even greater. The whole movie has a sense of childishness. Zhen Kungfu is not innovative, old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat, Jing Tian's characters are also problematic, and capable female criminal policewomen will shed tears because of killing criminals. The whole is loose and there are still many advertisements.
