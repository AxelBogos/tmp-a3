South Korean CJ Entertainment "one book, two beats" new mode. Maybe it was the preconception of the Korean version first. The interpretation of the Chinese version of young grandma Yang Zishan made me feel a little "made", while the Korean version of Shen Enjing's exaggerated words and deeds made me feel very upset. Although many of the details have been localized well. Gui Yalei, who has been in ancient times, is so beautiful!
