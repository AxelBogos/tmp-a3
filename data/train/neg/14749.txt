She's still in great shape, but Demi Moore is really old. Although there is my goddess Widow Sister starring, the plot is much more boring than expected, the jokes are not funny, the story is quite mediocre, not to mention compared with the hangover, even the humiliating journey starring Elizabeth Banks is much more interesting.
