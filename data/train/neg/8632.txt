It's a long time. Why isn't the movie over yet? I always think that when I look at it. Since Irene's father has always loved his deceased wife and is so indifferent to his present wife, why remarry in order to solve physical problems? At first, her father thought he was retarded. The plot is boring enough. Why can this be made into a movie?
