A film in which the argument does not support the argument at all. Use the means of fooling the law to deny the importance of the law affirming the meaning of life with contempt for life? This crazy so-called "belief" looks like a cult. PS: the weak question is that the human rights of ordinary people in China are like the moon in the water, why suddenly there are so many people who oppose the death penalty in China?
