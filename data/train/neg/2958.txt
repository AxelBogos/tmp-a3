I've been watching it for forty minutes. The sound track of this film is extremely poor, and the dialogue between the children in Feng's first scene continues until the end of the scene, and the giggle of the actor who plays the young Yang Mi is also repeated twice; the picture is extremely poor, the stiff collage workmanship at the beginning is amateur, and the matting effect such as falling off a cliff is more inconsistent than that of the old TVB TV series; the performance is extremely poor, not to mention the protagonist, and the eyelids of the girl sleeping on Yang Mi's body keeps moving. Xu an is too bad. Yang Mi has a pure face when she is a teenager.
