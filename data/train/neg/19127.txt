Isn't this the level of "storytelling"? Does such a thin plot have to be adapted into a 90-minute movie? Do you want to circle the money madly? This film all depends on Johnny Depp, otherwise it will be a mess. Besides, I wondered at first: how did the evil-enchanted Depp play such a suffocating role? Fortunately, at the end of the film, he returned to the id, applauding + throwing flowers!
