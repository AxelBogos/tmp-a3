Complain again that Douban can't comment on sporadic settings. In order to criticize current events that do not exist, forcibly imagine a political environment that does not exist. The round screen and shocking mountain cannon background music designed purely for pretending has no effect except to increase revulsion. The first time I left the movie halfway! I won't watch Feng Xiaogang again. Thank you.
