Why does a young girl have to be mentally retarded in the performance of Mary Sue? In other words, can't you get up with brains and restrained introspection? The pure love Mary Su of the three Kingdoms with different cultures of China, Japan and South Korea all have this tune, and the difference lies in the stupidity of the well-made, or the stupidity of the urban and rural areas. It seems that this is a question worth pondering.
