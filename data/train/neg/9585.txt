The police of a small town police station in Zhejiang all speak Tangshan or Shanxi accents. The director wants to imitate Ning Hao's "Crazy Stone". Unfortunately, the plot is too bad, the dialogue is too bad, the director designed the joke is actually very inexplicable. Put A Chinese Odyssey's classic explosive head shape and floating away action in the real environment, the effect will only be baffling. Most people in the audience did not laugh once from beginning to end, because we felt a deep cold and sweat welling up from our hearts.
