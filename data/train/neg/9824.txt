"being a man is just a dream. You don't have to be so sober." The sequel is out of control and feels rotten. Always feel that 2 is a lot less sincere, become official and preach. 1 has much more characters than 2, but the connection is also much better than 2. Very disappointed to continue the flight, this time the plane failed to soar into the sky and crashed into the road. Three points, bad!
