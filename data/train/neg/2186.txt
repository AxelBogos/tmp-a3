I always thought that the female actress was Miyazaki Kui, but it turned out to be rich and beautiful, and her performance was barely qualified. Compared with Hasegawa's role, Hiroji Hasegawa appears to be too weak, and the overall thickness of the plot is not enough. It is a common fault of Japanese movies in recent years.
