The routines and tricks are not new at all. I can guess the ending from the beginning, and I have a good sense of rhythm, but it is not difficult to put such a single-minded story. The love drama is the best in the trilogy, and some of the shots have an impact, and the rest is a collection of all kinds of stereotypes, but it is very much in line with the appreciation habits of "Chinese", and some nostalgic things hook me up.
