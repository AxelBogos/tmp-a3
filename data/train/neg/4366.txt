The rhythm is really slow. It takes a long time to beep at random. It's not fun at all. The game is nothing new, such an interesting setting, unexpectedly did not play well. The action drama has become a very stupid cosplay, and the eschatological sense is also perfunctory. My family Sanchi is really random to pick up work. This seems to be a wb producer, so the Americans still don't come to Japan? The special effects and art are not bad, but the lighting is not good. The picture is very dark.
