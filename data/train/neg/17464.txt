It was not scary. At first, the hostess was frightened by some small voices, and then the phone calls came one after another. The hostess friend came to her and was blocked by branches when she left, and then was killed. Not bloody, not too scary, but I was frightened by the atmosphere created by my classmates. Then finally the friend died in the bathroom, and when the hostess ran with the child, she found the maid dead in the garden pool. And then escaped. And went crazy.
