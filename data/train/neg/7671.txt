1. The plot is extremely procrastinating, and the dramatic conflict is 0%. The sense of mirror is very poor, visual fatigue, make people sleepy; 3. The extremely failure of characterization makes me more disgusted with the people of this nation. Does the director want to express class differences? Satirize the peasants? The display effect is relatively poor; 5. I still finished watching it in a second, and the movie experience was really bad. This film is really overrated.
