Who gave the anti-war label to reject the war not because of the thousands of innocent people who lost their lives and separated from their families, but because their relatives and comrades-in-arms could not be hurt? this value is enough to destroy all strict narrative and expression techniques to dispel and cover up the repentance and reflection of the war from a personal and emotional point of view. if the Germans made such a film, I also I will scold your conscience. It was eaten by a fucking dog.
