I gave you a 6.3 for Viking: battle of Kings.
The opening ceremony was magnificent, and the hunting in Russia's ice and snow forest showed a fighting national demeanor. But the plot is still the weakness of the Russian film, although claimed to have passed how many billion rubles, but the plot is still unimaginable!
It can only be seen in the battle scene. When the Turks attacked the city, it was quite spectacular for the defenders to put down the big fire wheel.
In short, it has the aura of a Hollywood blockbuster, but the plot is terrible.
