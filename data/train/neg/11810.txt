I find that my current political position often swings from side to side. I just watch bad movies like "return". I really think such a rightist view of history is really TMD. This thoroughly vulgar, sad and powerless view of history conveyed by this film makes me have almost no sympathy for the tragic suffering of the characters in the play. Well, I think it's because I've been reading Nietzsche recently.
