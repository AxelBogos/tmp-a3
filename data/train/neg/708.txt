Spicy chicken, I really don't know how low the punchline with high marks is. If it is a domestic film, it is estimated that you will all get a negative score. Spicy chicken is spicy chicken! There are not many jokes, and the plot is not worth deliberating! To make a scene in a rich man's villa, are there so many idiots in the house? Can't catch any of these people? Insult the audience's intelligence! Spicy chicken, waste of time!
