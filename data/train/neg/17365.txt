I experienced IMAX for the first time, but I encountered such an insincere remake. The event is the same as Spider-Man's first film online, but weaker than the first in terms of actor, rhythm and plot. It is originally a commercial product of low key, but it looks so thin and cheap when thinking of Batman at the same time.
