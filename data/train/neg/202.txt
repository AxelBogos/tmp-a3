Finally have the courage to watch this nonsense dinner, it turns out that it is really bullshit, even Daniel Wu can't stop it from giving it a star. Have the brains of these actors, directors and screenwriters been irradiated? How can you film something that is illogical and unreasonable? Can people jump out of the desert at will, or do you want him to come whenever you want? Risking your life to kill your brother and usurp the throne can you commit suicide because you were broken by a woman? Are you kidding me?
