I went to a classmate to play ps2 (or ps?) before I went to elementary school. I watched this movie before I went there. After watching it, everyone laughed with relish. After growing up, there are also 80 days in the world, kung fu, and so on. In retrospect, when it was easy to see a movie in a particular collection, what everyone really wanted to see was different, except that everyone's expectations for this kind of film were similar and, to some extent, inflated.
