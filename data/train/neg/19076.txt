A group of actors acted very hard, the plot is relatively flat, but there are still a lot of jokes. Small spoiler, there are stones, not heart-shaped Oh! What excites me most is the graduating students who are about to graduate and those who have worked for many years at the end of the interview, which is the year of graduation. If you grade the movie, give it two and a half stars (five-star system), one for the passers-by at the end of the subtitle, one for the joke, and half for free tickets. Thank you for the free tickets for the cinema's activities.
