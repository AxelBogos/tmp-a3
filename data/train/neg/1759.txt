When the images are made so ugly, don't come out to scare people. Every time they show up, they are painfully reminded of the "Ninja Turtles" from the last century.

The beginning of the film is the immediate sense of fruit-cutting game, the whole film seems to keep the mood high, but it still makes people drowsy.
