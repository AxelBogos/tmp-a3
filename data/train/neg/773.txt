There is no doubt that money is a bad movie, and the theme of Journey to the West is really getting worse year after year. The king of his daughter is like a pupil. The Tang monk is so greasy that he seems to be blind. The national teacher really can't tell that it is Gigi Leong. Who is she trying to set off by being so ugly? It really can't be cheap. 19.9 3D movies are really not as good as Monster Hunt 2.
