There is no best part, there is really too much difference from the expectation, deliberately increasing the laughing point is counterproductive, the embarrassment index increases sharply, the rescue process is boring, laughing and hanging around, and the pseudo-science fantasy film with neat workmanship is not amazing. I invited a lot of familiar faces to think that I was going to do something big, and the selection of "I Will Survive" at the end of the film was awesome.
