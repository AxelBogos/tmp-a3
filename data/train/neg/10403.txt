Very difficult to understand the logic, you want money to find an enemy to kill his wife, you go it alone, ah, drag down the whole team is nothing, stand on such a leader is really a dog. Lizzy is also very strange, think that someone took the money and killed his teammates one by one, at least find out where the money is before you do it, or else you won't get the money if everyone dies. I didn't notice that there was a slut in this film before, but I soon picked it up.
