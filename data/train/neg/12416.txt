If it is not well-intentioned and almost want to hit a star, who else makes a biography like this these days? even if you want to create a conflict, it is too deliberate. The opposing sides add a little emotional play to enrich the characters to create some emotional resonance, such as the CET-4 composition written by contemporary college students. The narrative efficiency is so low that it catches up with the Indian film, and follows the routine. I became Bai Blind Stone. Oh, I would also like to mention that lgbt is comprehensive, so where is your focus? Why don't you just put my nomination on your face.
