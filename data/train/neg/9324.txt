Douban is really tolerant of American science fiction films. This one has no value to watch except for special effects.
The plot of the old-fashioned Middle School II is not as good as the Chinese online novel, and the plot is so chaotic that people don't understand what it is going to say. Two words are always repeated in the head when watching the movie: far-fetched and unreasonable. Is it because I haven't read the comics? If so, please mark on the poster: those who have not seen the original cartoon should not watch this film.

In addition, as a science fiction film, there are a large number of things that can not be explained by science and have no scientific reason, which are unbearable. (manual dog head)
