I made a mistake when I wanted to see the movie version. The first episode was a little interesting, and then it was very procrastinating and abandoned. The whole show feels out of control and out of line. The continuous plot of the American TV series probably gave up completely, impatient, every one I have seen is very procrastinating, some of the plots are OK, and most of the plots are at sixes and sevens.
