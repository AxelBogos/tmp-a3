I really didn't expect to waste more time than the tv version. Characters read lines for super acting, lines need to pretend as if nothing has happened with too much background, but it seems very clumsy and deliberate, the whole process of didactic feeling. Obviously break a lot of settings but the rhythm is slow and lazy, to half of the settings can not be explained, and this already ridiculous set set to the audience seems even more silly. The character relationship is paler and flatter than the tv version. The music lost two stalls and became meaningless and futile in an attempt to render suspense, except when the picture showed an increase in budget and when it was time to see blood, it was useless to finally see blood, and the progress of the light picture had a ghost use.
