I found a fact: with a score, Douban won't let me write an essay. Blood Dizi did a good job in public relations. I had to change five points, write an essay, and then change back one point. In fact, I just want to say: this film must have been directed by someone else to Yin Liu Weiqiang. From the perspective of Infernal Affairs, even if Liu Weiqiang does not have a brain at all and talks in his sleep, it is better than "Blood Dizi".
