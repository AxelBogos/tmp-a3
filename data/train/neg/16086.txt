Now look back at how ridiculous the call for this film was to make it into the awards season. Taking the biography route means that the protagonist needs something to talk about in the past, but in fact, everyone has seen it, but it is not. 90 minutes are barely survived by nightclubs and bars. It is understandable that the heroes themselves will inevitably play amateurs, but what I cannot understand is that the whole production is very amateur. I would rather believe that Dongmu is just a name.
