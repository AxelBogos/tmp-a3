Douban is very happy. The name "three silly girls" is very apt. This is a typical movie that can't afford to make a disaster movie. The special effects remind me of the dinosaur super Kesai that I saw more than 20 years ago. I watched foreign bad movies for two days in a row. It makes me feel that domestic movies are full of hope.
