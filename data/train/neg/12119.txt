The title of the film lacks a subtitle: the history of love to be confirmed! A magnificent princess, flashy and undulating all her life, has been condensed into an unfounded history of romance by the film, which is ironic. Naomi's princess is undeniably beautiful, but are you sure the audience would like to see a blonde sleeping with a fat Muslim with hairy breasts?
