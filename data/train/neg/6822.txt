I probably had to watch the whole film for less than 30 minutes. It was the most boring Spider-Man I've ever seen. I didn't even want to admit that it was Spider-Man. He was the extension of Bug Iron. It was the next Tony Stark, the mannequin of spider suit, not Spider-Man / / character, not character story, not story, Europe, not New York, Zandaya, not MJ, Tony Stark, not Uncle Ben / Peter Parker, Queen. The average high school student in the district is a good neighbor of New York citizens. he's Spider-Man gone.
