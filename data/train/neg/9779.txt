Lars von Trier is committed to rebelling against the existing film-reading habits of contemporary human beings, and completely stripping off the "pleasure" in the viewing experience. He's really, really hard, making an "ugly" movie. As a director, magnifying emotion is the original sin.
Without sensation, extreme mental suffering is released at any time through an unbalanced lens. His characters are miserable, and we are even more miserable.
