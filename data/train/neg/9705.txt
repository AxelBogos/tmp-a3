There is also comedy on the label. It is indeed a comedy. The protagonists are very cold in telling jokes. It's very funny to find the acting skills of smoking. The theme is stupid enough. Just find an animal and say it's a cannibal. Such a big sheep bites the protagonist so muddy.. The protagonist also looks like a stupid child.. Dare to make a few innards gnawing pictures of this piece of fucking CULT? Oh, that's stupid.
