I really can't stand the broken atmosphere of making literary films now. If you don't learn to tell stories well, you can't learn to play with long shots. The old lady's foot-binding cloth is smelly and long, which obviously reflects reality, but the characters in the film have no sense of reality at all. Everyone reads lines with the same expressionless face as seeing through the world of mortals, but passers-by are very emotional and often growl. Really, these stupid directors should think about why no one wants to watch their own literary films, who is willing to stare at the back of their heads without saying a word for several minutes, and the camera has no aesthetic sense and no moral meaning. The film has a good intention, but the end result is malicious, a waste of my time, rubbish.
