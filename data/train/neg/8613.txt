If my mother had not been in numerous thrillers and horror films, how could I find this film to watch with her? there is nothing unexpected in the plot, the rhythm always slows down suddenly, and the protagonist can also make people catch chickens. Finally, I couldn't hold it up and fell asleep. Sleep soundly in the midst of the noise.
