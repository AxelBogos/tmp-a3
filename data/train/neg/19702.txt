The sound effect teacher really tried his best to burn the loudspeaker for everyone, didn't he? he often came to shout, the dialogue was soft and weak, and the bluffing sound was unbearable! The plot is so awesome that I've been fooling around for a long time, but I didn't even expect it a little bit. I'm so bored. Short hand, you continue to be a monster in Fashion week. You really can't act.
