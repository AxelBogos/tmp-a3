Too stupid. Americans who act in accordance with the law will listen to others instead of thinking about what they think they are. And the film shows that Chinese people are discriminated against by Americans, but they still cater to Americans to have a 'great' American dream. I was very angry at the movie and didn't like this kind of movie.
