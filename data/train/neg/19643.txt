2.5 Titanic 5 does not need to look at the top at all, although it is edited a little bit, but there is still a problem when the disaster occurs. Only Tong Dawei's good character line of Takeshi Kaneshiro can dig deeper. Yamei Nagazawa lives in the memory of 5 Mao special effects. I don't know what Huang Song line wasted time on the top. The director can't control this kind of film.
