To be honest, I didn't burn because I didn't understand it at all. The Indonesian film is still not good, the story is too weak, the character relationship has not been established at all, the whole movie is the same as bipolar disorder, the fury is really violent, when it comes to the drama, it drags on and cries, and the plot after getting out of prison is not sharp at all. The sequels of many films have an over-expanded worldview. The original theme film is the same as Avatar, and the loss outweighs the gain.
