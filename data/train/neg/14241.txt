There are Zhengtai, Lori, Royal Sister, and (countless) uncles. There is science fiction, there are comics, and (a lot of) blood and big scenes. Cass is not strong, the plot is not awesome. But how come the movie is so long and boring! The staggered editing of time and space is poor, and the special effects are average. It looks very thunderous. I was confused when I had not read the comics. I have to say that the cinematization of the comics failed. If all three movies follow this route, it would be a tragedy.
