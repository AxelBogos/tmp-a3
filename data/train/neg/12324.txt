It was really bad for two hours. I just felt that the dragging plot was bad at first, and at first I was surprised that the murderer could swagger out 15 years later, and it didn't take long to think that the real killer was doing a play to attract the prisoner. I really don't think that the real killer is so stupid and the protagonist's undead halo is full of action scenes where the police chase perverts and get rid of perverts. What's the point of adding traffic to the audience? there are too many troughs and no good at all.
