The only thing to watch is the cat teacher. Production is as simple as the tv version, and the ordinary script is forced into the length of the movie so that the rhythm is not as good as the tv version. The style maintains the refreshing and healing characteristics of the series, but it is only suitable for relaxing in leisure, and watching it in the cinema is too boring. The special role of non-professional cv is really unflattering.
