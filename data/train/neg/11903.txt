Action movies with imperfect structures waste too much time in Marco Wahlberg's soliloquy. At first, I wondered why so much time was wasted on the raid, and later explained why. At the same time, if we look at the film from a neutral point of view, this is a typical act of revenge. A group of teams paid the price for what they did. There are two big problems: the task of escort is not pure, and the action of fighting and shootout is incoherent. Too much switching of the lens creates a sense of unreality, and the second text is that the whole story wants to do both, but without success. In addition, the reason for finding a special unit on the Russian line is not clear.
Finally, it is not perfect that the entire operation team and the central control center were wiped out because of the shot of the hero, who did not die.
