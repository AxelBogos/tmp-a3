I really don't understand why such a messy pretending movie has become the love guidance of many people in Renren, chicken soup and the existence of an emotional savior. no, no, no. Fixed sentence pattern "after watching this movie, he doesn't really like you so much that you can really understand love.". Your sister! Well, it's a waste of Johnson and Connery.
