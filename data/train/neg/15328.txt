Short film platter, this is not fresh. Take it apart, every story is too weak. And its warmth comes from the fickleness of the whole film and the "holding" that refuses to touch the ground. The actors in a mess are updating the era of the Chinese screen in an all-round way. The section of Dapeng is the most offensive because it breaks the glass of people's feelings.
