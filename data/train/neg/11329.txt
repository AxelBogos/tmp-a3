Movies mixed with spirituality and love, the narrative logic is confused, it is simply to use mental illness to explain everything. Guo Xiaodong had a diving accident with Li Xinjie and Liang Luoshi. Li Xinjie encountered "ghosts" all day long. She was later found to be deranged. Liang Jiahui, a therapist, and her sister were fantasized about being possessed by a Shanghai woman. It turned out that Guo Xiaodong died when she was in a coma when she cut the thigh artery with a knife and finally fell in love with the sea.
