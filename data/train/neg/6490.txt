The plot is poorly arranged. Why does Ni Andong want to look for his mother's footprints? Why does Ni Andong know the smell of his mother? Why does Ni Andong like Chen Yanxi? Why does Chen Yanxi like Ni Andong? Everything dragonfly with water, trying to fool by. It's a nice scene, but it's a pity that it doesn't look good.
