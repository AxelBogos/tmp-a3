As always, it continues the humor, song and dance and inspirational colors of Bollywood, as beautiful as a real fairy tale. I just want to sigh that mainland movies are not as good as Bonzi, Ah San and even Thailand, which we have always looked down upon, let alone the United States, France and Japan. This exclamation comes at a time when the mountains and rivers of the motherland are dark on 815.
