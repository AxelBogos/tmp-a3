From time to time, I have the feeling of four stars ~ the picture ~ the actor is also suitable ~ Dapeng's small flat nose is actually a little good-looking ~ the end of the war suddenly becomes a star ~ rotten terrible ~ but the so-called colored egg is clear that this is a mental retardation film ~ mix it up ~ four corners are stupid and cute ~ want to pick up who can laugh at this piece together.
