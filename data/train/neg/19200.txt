Two and a half stars, I hate Ben Stiller's performance in this film. I thought his acting skills were not good in "homesickness" before, but not so annoying. I think he has great potential as a director. Maybe he is more suitable for him than an actor. In fact, the theme is quite good, but the rhythm is not good, did not tell a good story, the last part of the best part is not bad.
