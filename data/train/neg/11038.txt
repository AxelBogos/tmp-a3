Children's movies. Every time you see that the villain is about to win, he doesn't kill the pretence, and then he is suppressed by the hero. In fact, I like Green Lantern most, followed by Superman. As a result, in the movie, Green Lantern Qiongyao is possessed, and Superman talks about soul chicken soup to the villain. The Green Lantern was almost forgotten in the back. The only good thing about this is that I got to know a few villains.
