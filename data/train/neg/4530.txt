Since we want to put the background to the War of Resistance against Japan, should we talk about political correctness? How can such a twisted story stand up to those fallen soldiers and innocent civilians? Who will comment on their human nature who has been slaughtered by the Japanese invaders? If people like Ang Lee occupy the mainstream and invade consciousness, who will stand up and sacrifice for everyone next time when the nation is in peril? I'm afraid they won't all be ridiculed as those mentally retarded patriotic students in the movie. The sorrow of China!
