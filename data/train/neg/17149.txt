The trailer is simply a miraculous editing. I had a great expectation for this film. As a result, the feature film is very disappointing, the plot is lacklustre, there are no surprises, no bright spots, not even shock points. The action of the Jewish exorcism is simply a laughing point. The Dead Soul Box has no background, so there is less suspense. It was thought to have a reversal at the finale, but it is only a horror film with no colored eggs and low completion.
