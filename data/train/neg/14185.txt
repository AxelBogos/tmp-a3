I feel that the main line is unknown, I feel that the director uses two main lines, one is the emotion and the other is the suspense of the werewolf, and finally he doesn't know how to combine the two into one. Anyway, it's a mess in the back. In the end, the details and the main line were completely confused. The director himself may not have figured it out.
