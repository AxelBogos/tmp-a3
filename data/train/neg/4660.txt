What do you think of the editing? The pictures are filmed like that, and they cut them blindly, thinking that they can get a rhythm if they are made into a convulsive quick cut. How many viewers on the big screen can stand that crazy cut? (if the technology is not qualified, let's not talk about the movie itself.)
