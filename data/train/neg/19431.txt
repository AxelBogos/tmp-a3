So after the tragedy, do you have to torture each other for the rest of your life? is it all the sins committed by history and society, or is it artificially addicted to it? the movie seems to be trying to say that it's a story of the times, but it's completely unconvincing, and in the end, for three hours, it gets more and more procrastinating, and it gets more and more inexplicable, until the end is everlasting. Four big words suddenly appeared, and I almost asked. If the number comes out with the English name so long my son, I think it will at least justify itself.
