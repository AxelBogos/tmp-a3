Boring, no plot, the characters are emotionally fragile, nothing new still drove away the monster that wants to destroy the earth. What is most hateful is the poor translation, which has to misinterpret or overstate the original text, and even the film translation has to be monopolized by the related customers. Superheroes turn into concentration camps with sturdy bodies in weird uniforms, and fantasies about the rich are terrible. Watching such a mindless movie is a waste of life.
