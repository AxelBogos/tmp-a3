This kind of script really can't afford to hurt. Although it is different from the first theatrical version, this work is already a smooth painting style with a high fever of money, but this plot is too boring and illogical, do not ask for anything particularly wonderful, write the story carefully, not so many loopholes, the audience is not satisfied. Kubo cartoons are also gradually declining in the later period, and the crew and producers will not think so much in order to make money, anyway, they will not be able to make money until they cannot make money.
