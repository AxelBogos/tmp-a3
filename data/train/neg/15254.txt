Freaks under a lot of magic laws. The binary opposition between good and evil, obliterating the possibility and belittling the individual's growth struggle, "man will prevail over nature" is reduced to slogan sensation, with no intention to solve identity anxiety. Filial piety has become a means of tear gas, refusing to communicate in the name of "for your own good". The joke depends partly on shit and fart, and partly on the teasing of stereotypes such as the obese pig god and sissy. There is quite a sense of substitution, we all grew up like this, but jumping out of it is only physical and mental discomfort.
