Ugly, but also thought that perhaps the culture is not enough to make up for the original works, the result is even angrier after reading it. Nie Yinniang in the legend of the Tang Dynasty is simply dazzling, such a story of Luotuo interesting and carefree travel is actually filmed as Confucian Confucianism pretending to be evil, and the character is unattractive and at a loss as to what to do. I admit that this story is really only about loneliness, changed to this way, it shows that modern people set more restrictions than the Tang Dynasty, too much boring, filmed loneliness into patience and suffering, Director Hou went astray.
