Aside from the fact that multiple stories are carried out at the same time, the problem is that this practice of delaying time to recharge cards can easily be messed up, and the Jerry-building of any story will directly affect the mood of the audience. and the success of this film makes every story appear malnourished, it would not be comforting if it were not for the happy ending at the end of the film and the cute rescue of the baby. Ps: sister Cameron is really old.
