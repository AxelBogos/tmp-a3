There are many places to blame, but there is only one thing I can think about, that is, as a superpower, it is really not cool to shoot. In 2018, do people still feel more than expected about the conversion ability that Alien, Prototype, and even Spawn (that is, in the shadow of watching this book) have been flipped over and over? Just like the age gap set by Tom Hardy and the protagonist, he can't hide the stink.
