Perhaps I expected too much, but the film was not as good as I wanted. Coupled with the Mandarin version I saw, the play was even more dramatic. In fact, the more I grow up, the more I like to recall that it is true, and it is also true that life is paler and paler as I grow older. I hope I can find myself instead of packaging myself as others expect me to be.
