It's totally the hallucination of middle-aged male losers. The concept is good, but the story is too bad. The black-and-white tone was dealt with too early to expose the director's intention, without the slightest icing on the cake. Jiang Wu's character is a completely useless fool in any world. He doesn't understand the meaning of such a parallel space and how difficult it is to make a choice. The lines are poor, and the joke of forced entry is even more frightening. Tried to find a balance in commercial literature and art, but failed.
