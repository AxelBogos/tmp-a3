Real people + political conspiracy theory + news ethics + drugs + public opinion, a good theme is ruined by the mixer routine model. There are generally two ways of this kind of theme, either focusing on showing the progress of the situation, or focusing on depicting the image of the protagonist, but this film has nothing to do with each other. The director thought he was smart enough to put in a lot of meaningless plots in an attempt to make the story fuller, only to get two hours of pins and needles.
