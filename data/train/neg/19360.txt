A film that is not pleasing to the eye, Oda cut off the scenery film. The whole film was very awkward, and all the girls said that they were definitely in the top three of the most embarrassing movies they had ever seen. I quite like the two minutes when the male and female couple wanted / knew what was going on and then spent testing each other to see who took the first step. The atmosphere was so realistic!
