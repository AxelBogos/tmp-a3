In any way, there is no bright spot. I have a sense of watching Sherlock Holmes from time to time. The film itself has no focus, the principle of Enigma, Turing's thought, character, interpersonal, and even his invention have not been delved into. The most complete one-sided is his childhood. Negative review.
