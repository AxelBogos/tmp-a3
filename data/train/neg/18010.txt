If not, since the success of word-of-mouth marketing after the return of the Great Sage, all kinds of bad films have begun to frantically hire water army to score points. A good piece is easy to get, but a good platform is difficult to build. If Douban is occupied by the water army, where will you go to "talk about ideals"? Do you want to go to Momo? Fortunately, it can hold up, no matter how much praise can not whitewash the nature of the bad film, the score is right!
