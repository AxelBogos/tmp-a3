Two and a half stars, at least the Japanese version is really better than the national version, first of all, because the original is the Japanese version at least will not be dissatisfied, in addition, the settings and stories are taken in accordance with the original version without a sense of discord. But the story itself is really a mundane story, and I can't like it. I don't know why this script has been liked and noticed by so many people. There are two movie versions and one play version.
