After watching this movie, I deleted all the films by Yang Fan that I had never seen before. Old Gay's affected self-pity is almost a kind of self-deprecation, hypocritical and disgusting, and this disgusting film under the control of affectionate feelings. Feng Delun and Yin Ziwei are comedians. Can I stop pretending to be handsome? don't you two think you are acting in a Zhou Xingchi movie? The soundtrack is also very comic, and it laughs several times when the music comes together.
