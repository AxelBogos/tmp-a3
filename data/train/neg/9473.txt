The remake can even make the script worse and worse, the action design has lost its style, and the two protagonists are more grandiose than the other, and I don't know how bad it is compared to the original. In particular, the final tidbits actually played with Chinese trifles, and the director, screenwriter and producer of the chicken thief was disgusting. Spoil the original, desecrate the movie, you guys.
