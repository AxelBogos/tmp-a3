Such a good theme and story has been made superficial by writers and directors, and it is also quite difficult to make people unmoving. Mom, the more and more ugly, the mirror design is shit, a bunch of unnecessary things have been stuffed in, the soundtrack is simply not suitable for the scene. Obviously should be a good story, you can explore responsibility, growth, and fully release the warmth of the story. It's painful to force yourself to finish watching this movie.
