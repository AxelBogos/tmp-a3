This score... Tut-tut, really good-looking is justice, originally wanted to give a pass for this kind of show-off skill that Skerwell has always loved (you see, we can now show our teeth to this extent, what, did not see clearly? It's okay. Watch it a few more times. Come on. ), seeing that the score is so false, it's better to remember the two hours I wasted.
