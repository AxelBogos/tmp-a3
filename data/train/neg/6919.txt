Gong Li said that with her presence, there is justice. It seems that she really did not interfere with the choice of the judges, but I cannot agree with the Golden Horse judges' choice. Apart from the performance, I do not think the film is excellent in any aspect. The director's departure is a relief, leave the pain to me, may you no longer have pain. I want to tell people who have seen the movie to have a brave look at the world: there are days and nights, flowers bloom and fall, warmth and cold, light and darkness. Everything comes from your eyes and from your heart. We can't narrowly tell others that you see the world as boring, hopeless, and mischievous. The film uses the technique of changing long shots from light to darkness again and again, taking the actors to various dark corners to complete the plot, and the film ends with unknown darkness and unknown elephants hissing. Death is not terrible, everyone's common and only end is "death", but the difference is that you walk through a different path of life before death. The darkness is not so terrible, it is behind the light, turn around and you can see it.
