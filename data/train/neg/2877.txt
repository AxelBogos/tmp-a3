Thanks to this variety movie, I made up the movie tickets owed to Kangxi for the rest of my life. In the age of rampant feelings, being able to speak may not be able to be a director. Kang Yong gathered a variety show to make a plastic film. Instead of shooting the history of 18-line female stars in the entertainment industry, it is better to make a film about the struggle and struggle of male stars in deep cabinets, which is called Kiki's Love. Because we are more curious about how we are not monsters behind the story, rather than how traffic network celebrities realize.
