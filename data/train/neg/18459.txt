The film tells the story of two turkeys riding a time machine back to the first Thanksgiving, trying to stop people from using turkeys for holiday dinners. This seemingly creative idea does not work well in the film. The implementation of the whole "Save the Turkey Plan" is not as exciting as the "chicken run" style, and the drama part is not nearly as hilarious as the Great Father Fox.
