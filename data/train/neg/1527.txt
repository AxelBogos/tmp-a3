To avoid all kinds of realistic conflicts is basically about eating and how to prepare for eating. If this can also be called a feature film, how can it be fair to those screenwriters who strive for excellence and work hard to conceive the plot? As a documentary ok, as a plot movie, one star is too many. That's not the story I've read.
