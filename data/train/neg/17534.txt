Although it is based on real events, the rhythm of the film is not good and the characters are not well portrayed. The hero in the movie acts recklessly and has no respect for the team. he makes decisions on everything by himself, but he is neither smart nor rigorous, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the overall situation, regardless of the overall situation, although the action is successful in the end, but a large part of it depends on luck, the accidental element is too big. At least that's what the movie shows.
