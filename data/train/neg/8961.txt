I have never seen such a violent and brainless policeman. Guang-ho can tell a detailed plot but does not have the ability to operate. He is obviously a witness. It takes so much effort to go from the first half to the second half?! Gwang-ho said before his death that the killer was the one who threw him into the fire. The answer has already come out. How long do these policemen want ZZ?! Open ending is fine, but the premise of open ending is a wonderful process. In this plot, the plot is simple, the method of solving the case is stupid, the whole process is as stupid as shit, and finally the murderer is not caught, is it trying to annoy the audience to death?
