I thought it was a horror movie, but later it was found that it was not so scary, or that there was no element of terror at all. apart from the bad face of the man who sent the box, there was nothing to be afraid of, a very grotesque film with NASA, not a gimmick, and there was reincarnation at the end, oops.
