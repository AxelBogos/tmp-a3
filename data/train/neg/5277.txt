I downloaded some classic movie packages and brought them with me. I didn't read the introduction. As soon as I saw the beginning that Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Revolutionary Holocaust Communist chan,part, I knew what kind of movie it was. As a person who has the ability to think independently, I want to say: bullshit. My grandfather went to the Northeast Battlefield and the War to resist US aggression and Aid Korea. Although he survived the battlefield, what did gong give in the end? Shameless bastards, total part. Discredit Chiang Kai-shek? Bullshit movie.
