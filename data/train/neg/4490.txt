No law straight see, seriously... It turns out that the temperament and appearance of movie actors must be super high, such as JF, a handsome guy in the folk world, who is suddenly weak in the movie, the whole momentum, feeling, like a nerd. Still shooting that awkward sex scene with Hathaway, there's really no spark at all, okay? I really went to outer space. Take OK one star. Don't torture the audience.
