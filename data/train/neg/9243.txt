What I want to say is that the whole film is full of too much violence. From the beginning of the appearance of the big white bear, it makes people feel very frightened, adults, not to mention children, cousins say it is terrible. Compared with the bears that haunt the Spring Festival before, the tone of the whole film is darker. Regret it!
