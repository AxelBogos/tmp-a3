For three stories south of latitude 25 degrees north, the intertextual comparison is neat: parting at home and meeting again in another country is both reconciliation and farewell. The three paragraphs all have varying degrees of infantilism, and Xin Yukun's section is still as full of irresponsible coincidences as the "maze of hearts." the Thai section has the most serious sense of disobedience, and the ban on the lakeside of Chen Shijie is relatively better, even if it is called friendship. I can handle it through censorship.
