Look, half give up. The main reason is that Chow Yun-fat gambles all day and doesn't go to work (the job of carrying dishes seems to be done occasionally), so that he can fight against injustice and full of dignity, which is too unrealistic. It's a fairy tale. Huang Wanting may be a rich girl. I can't understand her world. Can romance be divorced from reality?
