Whenever I see this tasteless and mediocre work, I can't help feeling the value of imagination and creativity. Obviously this film is intended to make a horror comedy for children. I don't know if children will like this kind of film, but for adults, tick-tock House is neither funny nor scary, but childish is really naive!
