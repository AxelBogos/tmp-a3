People are confused but have no desire to explore at all. The prison of the Kuomintang reactionaries is so humane that they always stop to let the prisoners finish their emotional scenes on the way to escort-Oh, there is also a kissing scene. The screenwriter is so stupid that he has to copy half of the "Book with his wife" to write a suicide note, and there is no grammar to speak of. I have never seen such a brazen man.
