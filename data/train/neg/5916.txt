The experience of watching movies is extremely boring. Low attendance in North America is expected. To be honest, this film makes me feel the perfunctory tiredness and exhaustion of Hollywood animated film production. Especially at the screenwriting level, the screenwriter's creativity and imagination have basically reached a state of extreme saturation or even boredom. The whole film has no ups and downs, the Hollywood assembly line has a happy ending, tears and jokes are perfunctory to the audience. The intuitive experience in the cinema is: "Hey, how come it seems that boss died without anything and somehow forced a happy ending?" There is no philosophical thinking, but the Lego films of the same period are quite new. The villain weak chicken has no sense of existence, we can see that even if the propaganda efforts to create a dark atmosphere of thrilling stimulation and twists and turns, it can not save the boredom and boredom that comes out of the film. Maybe that's all he can do. Hollywood movies in recent years have repeatedly proved that the United States is a country with no culture at all. (waiting for the rise of animated films with Chinese cultural elements)
