Films that waste the audience's attention have to die. What I said before is inexplicable, and then I suddenly tell you that the story is like this, and then the foreshadowing is like this, can it be any weaker? I admit that actors can't be more beautiful, but they are weak compared to the big eyes of the humanoid mina! Bang! Yes!
