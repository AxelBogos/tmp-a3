The Anti-Corruption Storm 3 teaches you how to launder money in fancy ways. This series has always been mediocre, even below the average level in the ranks of many Hong Kong films. It should only be aimed at establishing correct values. I didn't really want to see it, especially the animation at the beginning was particularly fifty cents, but I didn't expect it to be quite comfortable. The plot is still compact, the theme is clear, and there is no extra love. This is a good job. Moreover, the logic of handling various cases is reasonable. I just feel that Zhao Meixin's role is set too stupidly. On the surface, she looks like a cold and flamboyant lady. In fact, her IQ is worrying. Buying a limited number of brand-name bags left evidence that I didn't understand. I was even convinced that I patiently answered the phone call from the credit card center in the end. I want to say that there are too many literary plays of such a large space. it was only after a few minutes of the shootout on Jiewei Street and the fight between the three people on board that we finally got the feel of the Hong Kong film. in addition, this villain really attracted the eye, and his appearance was particularly amazing. I haven't seen such a handsome man in a Hong Kong film for a long time, and the performance of the action play is also good. In fact, you can give it to a Samsung, but a certain speech is too pretentious.
