"Super annoying Spider-Man" can be renamed "Chinese Hero", and then Spider-Man can have a line: I am a lone star, and anyone who knows my secret will die. I don't know if it's the cinema. I'm going blind with the 3D effect. I really want to tell him, stop dancing, man, the 3D effect is so bad, I'm going to be jumped to death by you. As for the plot. I'm too lazy to complain. It's as if it was shot by a drunken director.
