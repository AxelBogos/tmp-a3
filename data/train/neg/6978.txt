Bullshit! After watching it for more than 40 minutes, I really can't watch it any longer. I'm afraid it will affect my love for Ruan Jingtian. The leading actor and the heroine pretend to be all in an era of stupid gold-panning dreams. Maybe we don't understand that era, but the shooting is really disgusting.
