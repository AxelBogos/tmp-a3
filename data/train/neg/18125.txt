The current case is about emotion, not technology, and the fetters of home guide fate. However, I really want to complain. What I can finish in 40 minutes is to confuse myself for more than an hour. I can't fall in love with stupidity, save the psychological outbreak, and can only lower my self-IQ. It's time to give up after watching Japanese movies and dramas for many years.
