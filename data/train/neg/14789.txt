It's really a terrible uppercase. I've never seen such an embarrassing Galaxy film by du Cannon. The script sucks and wants to show a state of anxiety and high pressure, but it is not well done and the end is completely cracked. Zhong Hanliang's character is demonized, but it is very unnatural in the film. To make matters worse, the supporting roles of Lu Haipeng, Lin Xue and Xie Tianhua drifted away from the plot, purely copying the roles of previous films. In the end, he bowed to the censorship system, too helpless.
