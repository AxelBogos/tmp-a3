A ghost story made up by a blind chicken is mysterious, but in fact, the director himself does not understand what to say. After watching it for a long time, apart from thrillers and all kinds of ghosts and zombies running out of the way, there is really nothing to see. In addition, the actors are all good, and the kids are great. It's a far cry from our family Park Tsan-woo. Besides, it's called bait. Koko doesn't have any theme anyway.
