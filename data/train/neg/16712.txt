"my ancestors were blind and told me to pursue knowledge. When I wrote travel notes, I was accused of leaking state secrets, writing history, I was accused of satirizing the present and the past, annotating the art of war, I incited rebellion, wrote myths, but said I was superstitious. In the end, I had no choice but to write biographies. Who knew that man was a rebellious party, and he had to arrest me in the end."
