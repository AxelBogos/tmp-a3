The acting skills of two stars for mental illness are so bad that the rest is complete rubbish, not to mention all kinds of myths. A psychologist with a normal IQ will go to the airport when he is wanted? A criminal sent back to see such a beautiful hostess also like to find a place to have crazy sex? We all found that 12 monkeys are fake. Would you please find a place to do your hobbies? If there is a time machine, there will be no destiny, and send a prisoner back to 1996 to kill the assistant.
