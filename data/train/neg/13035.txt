The quality of the picture is quite untextured, and in many places it is not as good as the game CG. The most important thing is that the script and lines are too common. We can see that the director has a deep post-80s plot, a lot of the shadow of Stephen Chow's movies, cobbled together, coupled with modern lines that are not in line with the background of the script, one word-- "chaos".
