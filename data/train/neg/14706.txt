If you don't tell the final truth, you really pay homage to the corpse film. Because in the former world of corpse films, zombies really existed. But now it's just an imaginary space, it's totally wild.

Not to mention the appearance of several kinds of bug, I can't accept the crawling appearance of Japanese female ghosts.

It's not that horror and aestheticism cannot coexist, but if you don't handle it well, it will only make people laugh.
