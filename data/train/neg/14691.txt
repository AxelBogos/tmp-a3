A group of exquisite wild animal puppets pass from house to house, unable to cross the valley of terror, and have lost their former integrity. To put it bluntly, the Lion King is a replica of the dialogue of Shaweng TV series. At that time, the best part of the cartoon was a big opening and romantic charm, but now it is as realistic as the National Geographic Channel on low. CG is powerful and useless, and its word-of-mouth is good.
