The lover who just disappeared yesterday, watching this film today, is also the adaptation of the novel. Why is there such a big difference? it should be the reason for the director's skill. I have also read the novel. The film was adapted in a hurry. The love line between Scudder and the prostitute was deleted by the director, and the plot dragged on. To be honest, this film is really not good-looking. Full score for soundtrack
