Looking back on the plot of the first film, which is so painful over and over again, I am afraid that the second film is to make the protagonist Nick lose his girlfriend again. Later found that the film is more realistic to let Nick wander in front of career and love these desires, the final outcome is still the same, you have to sacrifice yourself repeatedly in order to preserve the happiness of others. Like his father, Nick chose his own death in exchange for the happiness of all the people around him and his rebirth. The content of the first part is better. The second one looks like a poorly made thing.
