I saw it with my boyfriend at the cinema, speechless to the extreme. Although the rose petal fell down to frighten me, it still could not hide the boredom of this film, and it was another paranoia. There can't be any new ideas. "Purple House" and "second exposure" are all about a world of mental illness, and this film is simply terrible. I don't want to give stars.
