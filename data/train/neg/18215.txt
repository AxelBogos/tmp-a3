The movie Transformers has grown up children's animation, and this film has become a children's movie again. The plot is childish, suitable for children under the age of 18, at the same level as "Monster truck", with childhood scars, saving the world and old-fashioned routines to find themselves. no, no, no. Black teenagers have no acting skills and even have a simple expression. When King Kong fight, they feel that human beings are really superfluous, especially the heroine is more superfluous, and she always wants to get involved. In short, the special effects are good, the plot is childish, and there is nothing to talk about as a whole.
