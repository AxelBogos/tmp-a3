To tell you the truth, this film only has a three-star passing score, and the reason why it is given two stars is that the Water Army is too watery. Looking at a piece of five stars, it will only be offensive. The story itself is good, but many plots are handled bluntly in order to adapt to the "current characteristics". Finally, I would like to say that Wang Qianyuan's performance is still good. Lao Liu can only say that he passed. Xiao Liu, can we not play any role in the same tone?
