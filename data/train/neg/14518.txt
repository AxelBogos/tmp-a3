In my opinion, no character is established. What does the story have to do with 512? The surname Chang must be "Feitian"? The script itself is weak. The last "aphorism" speech is even more. The so-called documentary handheld shooting does not seem to show any truth and anxiety, but exposes the defect of the director's ability to dispatch on the spot. And where is the anxiety of the three hotheads who are not worried about money? If it's all anxious, then the whole world is anxious.
