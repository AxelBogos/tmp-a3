I would like to say that individuals do not like literary films, the shooting is extremely gloomy, and the way of telling stories is really unacceptable. I don't understand why imdb is 7.7 and Douban is 8.7. I feel extremely depressed when I watch it. I don't see the lightness of Shawshank's redemption. I'm not desperate even when it's the hardest time in Shaw, but this movie hides hope so secretly that I can't feel it without thinking about it.
