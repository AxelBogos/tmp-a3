Today is October 1, 2019. I inadvertently watched this film again, and it was interspersed with the military parade. At first, I thought there was Stephen Chow, but I didn't expect it to be GE Minghui, alas. GE Minghui is not as funny as Zhou Xingchi. If it hadn't been for Wu Mengda, Lin Guobin, Qiu Shuzhen, Donnie yen, and Shi Xiaolong, they would have been turned off long ago! The comedian Wang Jing wanted at that time could not surpass Zhou Xingchi. It is really Zhou Xingchi for a century. Alas, it is a pity that there is no one who can succeed Zhou Xingchi!
