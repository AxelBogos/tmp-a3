Freddy Hammer, this kid is growing up so slowly! The 18-year-old figure, the 8-year-old face, his eyes look like a deer, XD, a movie that should be worth three stars, was ruined by Emma Roberts' cheap face. I said, why doesn't this girl stay in the modeling world and insist on messing up low-budget movies? it's too bad.
