The so-called dramatic conflict in this film is one person or group of people nagging and then somehow running into the G-spot of another person or group of people, and then starting to swear at each other and get hysterical. Not only Aunt Mei, but everyone is high because they are so excited for no reason. What his misfortune, contradiction, weak.
