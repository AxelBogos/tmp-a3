Why didn't the heroine believe what her sister said after seeing the ghost? she didn't let her sister drink that bowl of blood in the end. Otherwise, why did the elder sister, who seemed to be very powerful and even afraid of Jiaoko, die easily in the hands of the male master? Apart from their "SB", I really can't think of any other reason.
