The plot is so mysterious that I can't stand this kind of psychic film. When I become a ghost, I can do whatever I want like a human being. Many people say that the ending is good, but the ending is nonsense. The original hostess's family turned into ghosts and thought they were ghosts and became human beings, so they couldn't accept this kind of plot. There is also a lot of religious dialogue in it, and the film is procrastinating. It doesn't look good.
