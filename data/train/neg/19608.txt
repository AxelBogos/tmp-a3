Compared with Confucius many years ago, this film is more like the work of Hu Mei, a commercial director who has transformed from the fifth generation. Although the film tells the historical story of Huipan's entry into Beijing, with distinct cultural symbols, it is actually more similar to revenge genre films, and the historical background has become the shell of packaging stories and characters. So in the film, each plot is in the conventional narrative law. However, driven by the smooth narrative, there are also extremely fragmented plot lines, extremely chaotic director audio-visual grammar, and extremely unknown viewing point of view. In previous works of this kind, the double portrayal of the characters' life and the past were separated by the author in the two male masters. In the limited space, the two can not really complete the effective contradictory connection and emotional interaction. This is not that Hu Mei is always making movies with the ideology of TV dramas, but the most intuitive embodiment of the so-called academic school lagging behind the development of the times.
