The plot is too thin, the content of the picture is empty, resulting in very boring, slow development of the plot, narrative only for narrative, clumsy! It's like the ambition to turn the first 15 minutes of Space Odyssey 2001 into an epic. It's a long way off. I don't expect to see a good movie in the cinema, at least not too boring!
