Unable to complain. This kind of bad movie always has stupid protagonists and supporting roles to promote the development of the plot, and the two aunts next to them keep complaining. It is a medical miracle that she was bitten by a crocodile without breaking her leg when she picked up her cell phone and made a call in a safe place on a rainy day. There is no such clear water in the basement, and the details are not in place. Do crocodiles lay eggs in water? I don't even care about science.
