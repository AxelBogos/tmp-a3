It makes me sleepy. Brother Tang, who is in love with his son and daughter, stirs up emotion and makes him stiff and embarrassed. The indifferent and boring hostess, the self-righteous daughter, the inexplicable father-daughter relationship, and the occasional play clip with a little 007 shadow is neatly designed, which seems to be a little better than Pine's action movie, but the whole is not good enough.
