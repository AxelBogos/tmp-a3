This is my most cheated film by Douban, because the high score chose it among the four films, which wasted more than two hours of my precious hours, damn it! No matter what the director and screenwriter want to say, I don't want to watch the movie like a riddle! Davidã€‚ Lynch, what an idiot!
In addition, these tens of thousands of people give this movie a 5 to prove that they are not idiots, or do they want to prove that they are idiots?
