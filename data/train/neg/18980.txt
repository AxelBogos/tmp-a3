What the hell is this? when I look at the picture, I think the score of Douban is on the low side, so I keep watching it all the time. It's actually good to use slow motion to drive the atmosphere at first, but it's not good to continue to be slow an hour later, and it's really annoying for the woman to look dissatisfied with desire, but female No.2 is more natural. Don't say anything about the plot, make a mystery and make a bad comment.
