It sucks... Maybe it was. I thought it was an action movie.
As a result, I didn't expect the plot to be boring.
I don't like Owen when I watch closer. Well, remember to see who the leading actor is before you watch the movie next time.
But still like the shooting method of Tom Tykwer, the structure of the scene is as beautiful as ever, full of tension, but full of cold and desolation.
