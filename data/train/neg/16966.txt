The story is really not good, very insipid. However, the heroine is very pleasing to the eye. After watching it, it depends on the acting skills of the two protagonists. The ending was so disappointing that after watching it for so long, it turned out that it was all a prelude, and the best part was left to the audience to YY slowly.
