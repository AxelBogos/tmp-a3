Douban fooled the father again, writing 3.6 points as 7.6, wasting dad two hours! A story is nothing if the logic is untenable, and there will always be a voice in the audience: no; it can't be so; I don't believe it; fake; don't watch it; so a bad film is identified in this way, but it also wastes the audience's time, damn it!
