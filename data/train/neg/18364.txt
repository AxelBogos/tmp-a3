"the five years that were stolen": it has taken up all the old diseases such as amnesia and terminal illness, and even made euthanasia, but some logic has not been clearly explained, such as how Xie Yu's ex-girlfriend disappeared later. Is Ho Man's so-called five years of amnesia selective amnesia? The sentimental and life-threatening tone of the film, and the aesthetic atmosphere of literature and art, are the same as the "breakup contract". Nomination: best Actress (White Lily) / Best Music. ★☆
