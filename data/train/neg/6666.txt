One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, it's terrible as a movie, it's a piece of shit. Fuck the grand prize. In the Film Archive, at the end of the film, I saw the confusion on the face of the people around me. I didn't know if I should applaud. After being embarrassed for a while, the beginning of the film still made several people touch each other with sparse hands.
