At the beginning of the film, the scene of people all over the street going to save the girl is really big. There is no such big scene in such a famous gangster film. Wu Mengda, as always, plays a small role, and he is very suitable for this kind of role. His nonsense style is not acting. I should be the same kind of character in real life. The disadvantage is also obvious, the script is too poor, the quality of a film should be based on the script. One star is given to the actors and zero to the movie.
