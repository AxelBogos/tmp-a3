It's the Boring or the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. Of course, this kind of Boring is deliberately pursued, and it is supposed to be of good quality and smooth performance (all actors have to imitate Woody Allen), but this film is too bad for Woody Allen, where are the lines full of humor and tension. He is not supposed to be an old man. "Midnight Barcelona" is so good.
