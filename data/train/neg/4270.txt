This is a movie with no plot, no fighting, no special effects, no special effects. I don't understand why it's not enough to hire so many stars to paint the wall to destroy Deng Chao and them? the character setting is also super bad, either wooden or silly Chen Jiashang filmed the four famous arrests. It's not a little bit to fool the father.
