I feel like I haven't played an one-star movie for a long time. Congratulations on this film. It's more rubbish than a domestic disaster movie. The way of thinking of going to copycat elixir from the different shapes of soap has lowered the IQ of the whole movie. This film is suitable for children's thrillers in the sixth grade of primary school and an introduction to people eager to spy on heavy-flavored movies. For those of you who don't want to eat noodles within a week after watching this piece, how can I stand eating potato chips while watching human centipedes at the same time?
