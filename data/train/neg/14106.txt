not good. Reason: 1. Template plot, kidnapping aesthetics; 2. The plot is too pipelined, and the limited plot seems to be singing in service. 3. Pretending to be confused about the reality of American society. And today, when the American Dream has basically gone bankrupt in the United States, this movie can still decorate the American Dream of getting better and better. I also admire the producer's colorblind racism. 4. The whole film is looking at the United States with white glasses, but pretending to be politically correct.
