The male pig is an artist, painting naked, running away from home with Lori, asking around for sex, the whole world should forgive him. Lori's sister could be painted naked by him, but not married; she watched a movie with her cohabiting girlfriend, touched her thigh, had an affair with her best friend, and finally got her sister, who was just an adult. He said confidently, "I'm going to marry your best friend's sister." but we can continue to have sex, but he's really not a scumbag. He's a great artist.
