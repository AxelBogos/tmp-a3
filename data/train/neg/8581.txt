I haven't seen such a bloody movie for a long time, and I can't even remember when it was the last time I saw such a dirty movie. A film with vulgar routines and doggy plots in all kinds of South Korean TV dramas has lasted for 130 minutes, which is also a kind of technical work. I suddenly feel that "the later us" is very good.
