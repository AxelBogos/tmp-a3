This Snow White is too old and ugly, and dare to say that she is the most beautiful woman in the world! Compared with the original Disney, the dwarfs are not cute, and the dialogue between the prince and the princess is even more disgusting! The whole film always wants to amuse the audience, but for me there is no laughing point at all. I wanted to say that this is the worst American animation I have ever seen, but I did not expect to take a closer look at it. Then the director also put English songs in what B ah! Are the classics of black foreigners really good?
