There are a lot of complaints in the plot. Finally, will a pregnant woman wear skinny jeans? Is the pants still dry when the amniotic fluid breaks? Can't you borrow your cell phone outside after you throw it away? Doesn't the delivery driver have a cell phone? You still have to go to the hospital while delivering takeout. Can you still be so upset on the way when the amniotic fluid breaks? Maybe foreigners are more open. If a woman is pregnant, will the two men not have a big fight when they don't know whose child it is?
