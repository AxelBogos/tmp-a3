Fan Bingbing represents a kind of female, a product of the patriarchal society, who wants to win with her appearance (although her appearance is very vulgar, the maid Fan in a comment is indeed more appropriate). Instead of conquering people with talent (that is, acting skills for actors) and moral character, she can only satisfy her Mary Sue dream with the most superficial things. Fan Bingbing has been telling me what to do for herself, but have you ever thought that this is just a movie, not real?
