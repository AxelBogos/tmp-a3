The friendship between the United States and Japan was established at the beginning, and it was a dream at the beginning. Long hair looks much better ~ ~ come out of a magic movie like the Ring ~ and YUKIO's long dialogue, I have skipped ~ Don't talk so much! Is this the story of Wolverine and the Japanese girl? there is no favor at all. The YUKIO fight scene is much more handsome, and the sword man is also much more handsome. And why I can't connect with Wolverine 1 at all. Who is that dead Jean?
