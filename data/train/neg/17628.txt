This movie really doesn't look good. Is it because the hero has too many fans? Recently, you from the stars are very popular, and this film has been turned out. But I think it's a far cry from the gifts and horror live broadcast in room 7. Maybe I don't understand the problems between North and South Korea. Kim San Pang, have you seen it?
