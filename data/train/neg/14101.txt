Maybe I am still a little short of literature and art. The insipid narration and poet's expression make the whole film look very dull and tasteless. The long shot of more than 40 minutes makes the whole film look more empty. I'm not used to the dialects in the movie. The only thing that can be mentioned is that the episode "Little Jasmine" is not bad.
