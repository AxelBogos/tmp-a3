This is one of the few high-scoring movies that let me down. Disappointment is the gap between it and "in the mood for Love". Wong Kar-wai's handling of the same extramarital affairs is much more advanced than that of Eastwood. This is Wong Kar-wai's way of dealing with it. The restraint and forbearance of "in the mood for Love" from beginning to end is the most charming aspect of middle-aged people, so "in the mood for Love" is like a work of art. From the moment Robert had a physical interaction with Francesca, the whole movie became cheap. To my disappointment, Eastwood was 65 when he made the film, and his mindset should not have stayed at the level where the affair was uncontrollable and then went to bed. Yes, this is indeed very realistic, and many people understand that it is not easy for a woman who is a little tired on a farm but still has a young girl's heart to restrain herself when she meets a man with a sense of art and fantasy who travels all over the world. However, no matter how beautiful the mistake is, it is still wrong, and their love scene loses the more beautiful and charming height that the film could have: that is restraint, which is also the most wonderful part of human nature.
