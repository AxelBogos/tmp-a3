Now domestic movies are easy to make a 3D, do a little one or two shots deliberately TM to fool the next screen, even the aunt selling onions told the wind that this is a good 3D, the effect is perfect Avatar I wipe! The whole process almost no depth of field, take off the glasses will become 2D, no ghosting at all, the real naked eye 3D!
