After eight to nine movies, I almost took off the powder. Don't brag about your feelings with me. Just make a good movie and leave it to others to pay tribute to yourself. When Quentin's movies rely on blowing their feelings to win their eyeballs, it will be cold. Barely saved by the last half hour, however, the only effective plot of the film was pushed by narration. I almost suspected that the film was not directed by Quentin, after all, his coquettish narrative ability was the core of his violent aesthetics.
