This film is about concept. It's not starring Daniel Wu. I'm definitely not interested in watching it. The film is full of screenwriters' ideas, based on current social hot issues, urban schizophrenics, black-hearted factories, fake and shoddy products, etc., but it's a pity that I got a very limited theme after a long circle. I watched a farce. And I don't see the sense of joy. Less verbose procrastination, less disorganized, concentrated and accurate expression and sublimation of the theme is what the director needs to learn.
