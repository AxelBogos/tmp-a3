This film perfectly explains what is grandiose force and affectation, and at the same time, it also pours "Hollywood narrative" into this Infernal Affairs, and the process of watching it is really all kinds of unhappiness, especially the shot at the end is really inexplicable; the only thing praiseworthy is Jack Nicholson, God!
