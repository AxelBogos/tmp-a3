Can not complete the first part without any innovation no, Suck! The effect is equivalent to "Butterfly effect 2". At the same time, I am also quite speechless about the modeling of the actors. Is this "Altman"? But I am more speechless about the actors, especially the male number one, the big front page Li Xiaohu, when can I stop pretending to be cool? Is there no other expression? If you have nothing to do, you should light a cigarette before you check the car. You can't hold it without a cigarette? All kinds of acting skills are terrible!
