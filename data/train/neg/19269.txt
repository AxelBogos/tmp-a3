I don't know why this movie is recommended on moments, and I don't know why it has such a high rating on Douban. When I saw it for 30 minutes, I thought I had the wrong movie of the same name. Skip to the second half and see the legendary Faye Wong and Tony Leung Chaowei are convinced that this is the film. Except that Takeshi Kaneshiro is very handsome, Faye Wong is beautiful, Liang Chaowei looks like my brother, and Lin Qingxia's shape is very suitable for Fan Bingbing, there is nothing to say.
