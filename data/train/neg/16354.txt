If it hadn't been for Emilie Simon's soundtrack, the movie would have been as boring as Marcos's look; it would have wasted a trendy start. In fact, pretending to be losers, the protagonists and heroines are nothing new except to show their loser demeanor, let alone any French romance; or I don't think Odelita is good-looking at all.
