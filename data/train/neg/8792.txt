It doesn't make any sense, but the end result is ragged. Can the adult's heart be transplanted to the child's body? I checked Baidu and said that the transplant should not exceed 22% of my body weight, and there was an example in my big China News, but the donor's heart was relatively small, and the doctor changed his blood vessels, which made him feel good. And I personally think that the rejection in the later stage must be much larger than the normal transplant. However, the film did not mention this difficulty at all. It can only be said that this movie should be fun, and the screenwriter will be more intelligent.
