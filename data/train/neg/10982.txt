The script is a mess, the rhythm is messy, BUG is a pile. For example, cases with a large number of explosives have been loaded into taxis, and even if they are not disposed of, they only think about hanging the big fish behind them, and they simply do not take the safety of the lives and property of ordinary citizens seriously. Is this really the policing principle of the Hong Kong police?
