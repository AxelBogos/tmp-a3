A few years ago, because of the forced demolition (no relocation) of the urban planning, a group of old people who were defenseless by the armed police and then sent them away for only a few thousand or tens of thousands, it made me feel cold when I thought about it. This film does not know what ghosts talk about superpowers, let's talk about social problems, the storyline is too weak, and it does not give actors a chance to perform. I doubt if they are watching the same movie with so many high reviews.
