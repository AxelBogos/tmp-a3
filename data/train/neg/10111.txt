It's a pity that I watched a long film without watching a short film, and the director chewed several jokes over and over again, as if, "Oh, I found a special idea called time pause. I won an Oscar. Oh, I can't think of any other ideas for the time being. Let's play this joke over and over again." if you cut out the only good ideas in this film, delete them and drag them together, ah, it happens to be a short film.
