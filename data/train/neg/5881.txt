This is obviously an ironic film, why do some stupid companies want to show it to their employees as a telemarketing motivational film? Sure enough, isn't the thinking of bosses understandable to ordinary people? In addition to Leonardo's excellent performance, the whole film is a completely out-of-date sex dream of chicken blood, okay?
