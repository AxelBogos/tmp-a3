It has nothing to do with the original work of Ghost playing the Lantern, but made a messy, unimaginative vulgar fantasy film with the help of Ghost Lantern IP, which imitates the sci-fi adventure elements such as the three-body star civilization and the concept of Pacific Rim wormhole and Godzilla modeling. The story is too weak and has faults, and it is also the love between Li Chen and Zhao Youting and the love of aliens and earthlings. Even if we give Lu Chuan a few hundred million more, it will be nothing more than a few more red birds. If you always play the propaganda with ghosts, you will be besieged by the original party.
