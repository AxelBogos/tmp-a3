As long as you make things clear, it doesn't matter if the logic is not so smooth. You can still kill time if you can't get out of Hollywood mode. But what about that body? Frankenstein was pieced together from a dead body, Adam, okay? That's the basis for this film, isn't it? How about a little respect for this setting? The most unbearable thing is "what are you going to do?" take a break from personal heroism. Please!
