Too many close-up shots, the pace is too slow, looking at the dizziness, a master and disciple will laugh at the whole audience as soon as they come out. Martial arts action film is a concept do not understand, do not know what Zhang Zhen came out of the fight strength seems to have nothing to do with the film, than Donnie yen's Ip Man do not know how ugly. If all martial arts movies are made like this and never watch them again, Wong Kar-wai's films still like Chongqing Forest punk most.
