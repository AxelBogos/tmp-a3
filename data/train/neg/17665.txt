If you compare selling copies with Quentin, you can see the difference between good film school students and ghosts who follow the rules and are nothing new. The director is so narcissistic that he thinks he is so good at filming that he is reluctant to reduce it for a second. I was suffocated for three hours. Cut it into an hour and a half to give you an extra star.
