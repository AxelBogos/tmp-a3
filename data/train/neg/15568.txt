Hard old and wet is not my type at all (thin-lipped lovers pass by). As Heathcliff, his appearance is really too dramatic, there is no sense of gloom at all, and the hostess is also too modern with a big mouth. Although I have only seen Wuthering Heights with this three versions, it is hard to say who is worse than Dalton's.
