Is this a comedy? When he Zhengyu chased the heroine, he almost wanted to laugh. I've read the original before, but I can't remember it clearly. If a woman takes the initiative to operate on Yile to treat her illness, is she selling her kidney? It really touched people's hearts that the father raised money for his sick child. I feel a little guilty.
