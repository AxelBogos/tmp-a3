Spielberg and Hanks are definitely the best partners, and their film department is relieved that they can't understand the hero's father. After watching the film at 2: 00 a.m. on April 22, I learned that Spielberg died on the 19th when I was watching the introduction. How come there was no news at all before? It's so strange that Baidu encyclopedia is faster than news? It feels like false news, Baidu encyclopedia is also too unreliable, feel free to change it!
