Hovering between general and disappointment, I still chose to be disappointed, the storyline dragged on and no progress compared to the TV version. The Chinese dubbing in TV also stole the limelight of the original version. Although moved out of David. Hasselhoff guest star, but it must be said that the production effect is extremely naive.
