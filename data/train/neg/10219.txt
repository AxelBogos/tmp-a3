I don't understand why I gave this article such a high score on the Internet. in fact, it is a successful autobiography of a boring and coquettish man. The man's successful experience is familiar to everyone, so it is not attractive, but the key is that the film is not made very well. Seeing the high score of 8.3 on Douban, I can't help but wonder what you can see about this piece.
