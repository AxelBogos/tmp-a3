Reluctantly relied on the last Central drag racing to save some good feelings, but unexpectedly even lost a lot more than the first film, Qiu Litao really couldn't keep the basic set recently. There are great problems with the respective settings of the Iron Triangle and the relationship between each other and the progress of the plot. Many feeder plots are forced into it without figuring out how to use it, and there is a lack of decent high points. I feel that it really doesn't make any sense for this film to be filmed under the name of anti-drug.
