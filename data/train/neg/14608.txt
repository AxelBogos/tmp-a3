Originally wanted to see Fang Hua Pai film too little to see this film, the concept of the film do not agree, many people cry into tears, better than everyone has an ex, so there will be empathy. The separation of loved ones is always sad, but what I think in my heart is that if we are together, we should cherish it, and don't get separated because of misunderstanding and anger. I hope there is only one reason for separation, that is, I don't love anymore. who can tell the things of love? may we never lose the ability to love.
