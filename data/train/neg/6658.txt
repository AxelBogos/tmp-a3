This is really a movie that makes me think "the acting of Big S is good". It's going to cry. It's really a touching movie. I am deeply impressed by the acting skills of loving shit. Put a chicken in the Phoenix heap and immediately appear, but the chicken that has rolled in the Phoenix pile will be released to the chicken flock immediately and it will be seen that the chicken has been stained with Phoenix hair.
