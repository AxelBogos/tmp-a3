The plot is so weak that the atmosphere of suspense is difficult to maintain, so that the passive act drags on to pay no attention to the truth at all. The disclosure of the Big BOSS is indeed unexpected, but it is still not in place, and some character relations are still not explained clearly. In short, it is too hasty and comes to a dead end. The whole film wants to create an European and American blockbuster that is humorous but not thrilling. I can only say that the joke setting is more stupid.
