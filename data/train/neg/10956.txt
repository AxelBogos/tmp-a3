The story of a poor and bored linguist selflessly helping a beautiful flower girl. I thought it would be very interesting, but it turned out to be very noisy, and it was really super noisy. The story of the old movie unfolds slowly and is not very suitable for the fast pace of modern times. Even if we watch it twice as fast, it still doesn't look good.
