The plot is procrastinating and the lines are childish, which is a cartoon for children to consume. Without the feelings and narrative style of previous adult fairy tales, even 3D felt that the film was very weak. Simple McDull's words are not as thought-provoking as before, but feel naive and childish, a little old-fashioned. Looking forward to going to the cinema in the rain to see the movie smashing its own sign is a bit sad.
