"Pancake Man" as a colored egg out to harvest a wave of feelings on it, insatiably saving a movie to make another profit, too disrespectful of the audience's IQ. This bowl of cold rice is not only stale, but also insufficient. What about Jiao Pi and Zhu Yongtang?

This is a typical piece of mediocre and boring works created under the mentality of speculative creation. The story is extremely boring, and the motivation of the characters is like "handing over to the country" in the grave-digging film, which eventually becomes the most annoying look set by the people at that time. Why do you have so many fragmented flashbacks when you can tell the previous history of a character in a minute? Stealing and robbing bridge segments are all kinds of imitations, and the car-chasing explosion special effects shots are rampant and rough. What is Shiman doing out here? I thought the knife could be used behind the pendant sent by Zheng Yijian at the beginning, but there was no such thing.

What happened to those awesome big brothers? A Shanxi eldest brother in the "jianghu sons and daughters" next door, even if he is poor and paralyzed, at least stubbornly adhere to a stream of jianghu spirit. It would be nice for you to be cute, a handful of Hong Kong big brothers, play COS handsome and play cool. You are only one tattoo away from Tian'an Society.
