Expectations are too high. I'm still disappointed. As a ghost film, the special effects are OK, but the degree of horror is too weak, and the ghost in the film does not make much decision, so he is directly stunned by his wife, slightly disappointed. At last, I realized that this was a romantic film dressed in a ghost movie. It is a pity that the ghosts of Guojiayuan and Guo Caiyi are too insipid and do not have many bright spots and highlights. No, the cameo of the scholar at the end of the film is Xi Xi.
