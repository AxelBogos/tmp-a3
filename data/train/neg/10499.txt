The plot has ruined 007.. It's no problem to make 007 go from god to man.. It is the director's problem to let him go from God to a loser. The long-shot conversation is boring, and the fight is basically nothing new. The splendor of the background in Shanghai has transcended the fight. The whole feeling is a film made by a western cowboy director. 007 has no essence at all.
