The plot is very ordinary and the mind is very empty. The film is interspersed with famous quotes and ideas of many philosophers, but in fact, apart from attracting people's attention with male flesh and homosexuality, this film does not delve into and depict more stories and characters. The integration of famous quotes and quotes is a failure. In addition, it is disgusting to use the words of deceased philosophers to make excuses for promiscuity. PS: teachers and students don't get an erection when they have sex? Then there are exposed birds?
