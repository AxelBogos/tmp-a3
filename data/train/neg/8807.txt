One liter of dandruff-- Film Review of "Tangshan earthquake"

In order to show my patriotism, I prepared a liter of tears before watching the Tangshan earthquake. Brother Fa had said before that it was not the Chinese who did not cry after watching Confucius, and this time Director Feng added that it was not the people who did not cry after watching the "Tangshan earthquake". After watching Confucius, I shamelessly hid the fact that I didn't cry, so in Fage's eyes, I still followed.
