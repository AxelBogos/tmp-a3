I went to the cinema at the first time when it was first released many years ago, and now it's finally the last movie. Being unsentimental is purely a pastime. I've wanted to smoke a director since the order of the Phoenix. The wonderful battle choice in the book was a mess; many important plots were deleted and changed inexplicably; 7 paralyzed Harry obviously grabbed the Hawthorn wood directly by hand and became the master, but in the end he broke it without repairing the Phoenix feather. it seems that the most important thing to cry is the old wand.
