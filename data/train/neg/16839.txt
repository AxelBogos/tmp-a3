I feel that this film is the concept of "parents kill their children" shot casually while taking drugs after the director suddenly came up with an idea, but it has no sense of substitution because of the lack of necessary previous confession. Editing is also a mess, often before you are still immersed in the tension of "Cage chasing Kids", suddenly the camera turns into a warm picture of him and his son having a heart-to-heart talk. After watching it, I felt that the whole person was divided into ðŸ˜¨.
