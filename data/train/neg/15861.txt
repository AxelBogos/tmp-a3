In the original work, there is a plot in which the woman smokes in the car, and I am very disgusted, but when it comes to the movie, such a plot still exists, and when I look at it carefully, I am surprised that this is indeed a closed train car. It is stupid to smoke in public places in Japan, and why is there no one to stop it?
