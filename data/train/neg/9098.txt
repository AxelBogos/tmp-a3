After watching the first two films of tiny Times last year, I said that no matter how bad Guo Jingming's film is, it is better than "living in Fuchun Mountain". Now I take it back... Photography is good, eggs are interesting. As for this sad and funny plot, it really shows the fantasy of dog blood that junior high school girls can write into erotic novels incisively and vividly. It must be popular in junior high school and below. Give 0 Star (I look forward to watching tiny Times 4 in the cinema while laughing and complaining loudly. Haha! )
