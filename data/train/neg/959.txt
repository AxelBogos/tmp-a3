Are you kidding me? The United Fleet was wiped out, Tokyo made a barbecue, and the domestic people could not eat. Take a group of child soldiers out and let the opposite plane rub against the sea. Can the government still wash this kind of rubbish? An army full of defeatist sentiments, with corporal punishment in vogue. Dying and daring to die can change the fucking concept. It is just because it sank after a little soy sauce, and the ship was blown up to the sky, the ancestor of the concept of weapons.
