Bad movie, bad alien movie. The special effects cut corners. It doesn't look interesting. Also fake want to explore the relationship between cowboys and Indians, who sees this kind of film is for this point? The new 007 is OK as a muscle stick, but it's really not suitable for 007. A bit of a gentleman, not at all.
