Originally, I was looking at the three male stars, but it turned out that Wang Baoqiang himself was a pig's foot, and neither the male nor the female was so good, but the performances of Dapeng, Xiao Shenyang and Yin Zheng were all right, but the three combined stars were not for them. One star was for the last monster. It is not easy for China to make such a monster. It is worth praising. It is better to write more articles from this monster. It may be a type. We haven't reached the active technology yet.
