Poor knockoff Korean film, the so-called reversal, the plot level is simply not as good as an episode of OCN TV series. It's basically a Korean story, but the annoying heroine will jump out all the time to help people feel the elegant demeanor of domestic films. What misunderstanding does an idol actor like Zhong Hanliang have about his acting skills? why do he feel that he can become an actor without showing his face?
