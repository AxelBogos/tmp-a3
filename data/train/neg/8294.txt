After seeing the warden, we can guess the development and ending of the plot. The action is not smooth, the hero is short, bad and ugly. Asians are like Koreans, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese. I guess the director didn't figure it out either. After watching it patiently, I hardly laughed. Maybe I was too serious.
