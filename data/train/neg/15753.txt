Although I marked the movie I saw on May 5, 2014, I unwittingly found Chen Weiting today. My male god Chen Weiting?! Guest starred in a lesbian movie?! Oh, buy it! This degree of surprise is no less than the discovery of Sherlock in the love history of the lesbian drama Nancy. (goodbye manually) there was no score at that time, this time add one star to the male god!
