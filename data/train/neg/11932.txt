I don't think it plays an important role in the emotional drama in the film. on the contrary, I think it may allow us to understand the life of great people from all aspects, but is it too superficial to set off the love of great people with the background of idol drama? I have always felt that the true feelings emanating from the heart can not be shown by the splendor of the background, but the acting skills of the actors should be matched with the appropriate scenes, while this play is mainly counter-guest. And the hostess is too small Jasper, it is rare.
