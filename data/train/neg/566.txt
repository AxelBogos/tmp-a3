This kind of urban romance film seems to be very popular with little girls, but it is actually very bad and meaningless. In the old-fashioned story, frustrated men and women comfort each other for a long time, rebirth misunderstandings separate, and finally love is greater than heaven. The stiff and abrupt plot advance, the junk advertisement implantation, the leading actor and heroine who does not match and does not lack of money, the inexplicable supporting role emotional line, a pile of chicken soup text narration, plus the false beautiful picture, can persist to watch the end is also strong enough!
