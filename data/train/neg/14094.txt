Wtf, you have to save them, so the civilians living outside should be eaten by dinosaurs that run out for no reason? Regular and mediocre, and the metaphors for China and Russia were boring and stiff, and when the tyrannical raptor started the auction, I thought it would be the Asian and Russian bid, and there was no surprise. Ps: the little girl can let Lily Collins play it when she grows up. And my favorite shot of the whole film is the last moment of confrontation between the lion and the dinosaur.
