Dressed in the appearance of literature and art, it is essentially western-centered, and 80% of the film is stereotype Japanese. The story is nothing more than two white people lost in Japan's "exotic" oriental culture, everything is different from the United States, people can not even speak English, really boring, it is better to go back to the hotel. White men get high, only promised land is the best in the world, hehe
