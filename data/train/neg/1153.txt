After watching the movie, I watched a few essays, and there was only one thought, the emperor's new clothes. Probably only the screenwriter enjoyed himself and felt that he had installed a good hand to kill the film festival, but he was not forced to pretend to be a friend when he went out the door. Those who say delicate, true, introverted, maybe the choreographer and director came out to hide from the corner to see your jokes. A story, two and a half hours, to remember the audience. To be clear, the film is not a comedy and has no plot.
