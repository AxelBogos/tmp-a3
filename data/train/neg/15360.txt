Barely two points. I slept once. I don't understand why Ridley wanted to make such a film for his brother after Tony died. There is a big problem with the story of Exodus. God is an underworld brother here. He doesn't pay attention to principles and depends on his mood. When he thought of the boys who fished out Egypt, he brutally killed the Egyptians, fucked up and disgusting, and even the Hong Kong underworld wanted the boss to talk about morality and rules. If you can't handle the image of God properly, it will be impossible to tell this story logically. Compared with the avant-garde cartoon Prince of Egypt, this film is lethargic, all the supporting roles are functional characters, and Moses is a single-celled creature (the more reasonable and rare the Last temptation of Christ). The main focus of the film is a few CG scenes, the sudden array of Egyptian chariots, suffering from the river turning red flies flying all kinds of punishment and so on, the effect of the Red Sea separation is general. All the actors painted eyeliner, thick eyebrows, greasy ratio, coupled with a dull performance, it was ridiculous.
