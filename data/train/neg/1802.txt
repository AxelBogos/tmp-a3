After 2 hours of rubbish stories, only CG is good! I can't watch it until I finish it! The story and logic are extremely rubbish ~ 36,000 battleships were defeated by a warship! Said to go back to the past to return to the earth, and then become the destruction of the earth, and finally the consequences of the pirate captain, and so on! Rubbish!
