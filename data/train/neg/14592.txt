After watching it, I want to go back to the three episodes of the old version. All the opposite plays can not be put into the play, and the lines are as full of meaningless repetition as drool songs. It turns out that one of the three enemies of propaganda is only a big head. The new version has reached the second episode and is still unacceptable. Those who score according to their faces are really enough. Spider-Man should never be a handsome guy or a beautiful woman.
