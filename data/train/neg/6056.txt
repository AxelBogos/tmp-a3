One of the series is worse than the other, and the second one at least has something to do with the first one. This one has nothing to do with mountain villages and old corpses, even if Li Zi plays a different role. The film tells the story of a film crew shooting ghosts in abandoned buildings and accidentally releasing ghosts. Later, they all bumped into ghosts. It turned out that the ghost fell in love with the female master and wanted to marry the female ghost. The original good story is really bad enough, not as good as the living state of the crew expressed in the real feelings, but also added some funny elements and a little porn to wipe the ball. I don't know why Ye Shirong took this kind of screenplay. The heroine looks good, but her acting skills are not good. Li Yaoxiang, Zhang Daming and Jiang Haowen are not bad even if they act in bad films.
