I really don't know what the director is trying to express. A group of stupid punk players meet a bunch of more stupid criminal gangs, and then there is a long period of boring killing and anti-killing, and the plot is mediocre. I don't know what the ghost is at the end, Professor X, please have a bottom line to pick up a bad movie.
