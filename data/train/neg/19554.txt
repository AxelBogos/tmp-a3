It is a completely flirtatious movie. After watching it, I feel that this is the story of one of the poorest families in Iran. Father and son are filial, and they don't steal or rob. Iran is already a country that Mencius said, "pay attention to yourself in obscurity and care about the people when you have status." A boy who was often late, came home from school to help his parents, and accompanied his father to look for a job on weekends, came first in a marathon with a combination of moral and academic excellence, wearing worn-out shoes and running casually.
