The movie Rome is the most disappointing film for me in 2019. How much I expected of it before, but now I feel that these more than two hours are a waste of time. Those metaphors that can be understood at a glance are the pursuit of freedom, the satire of the government, the commemoration of the revolution and the call for equality. After all, they are just self-fantasies of the director living in memory.
