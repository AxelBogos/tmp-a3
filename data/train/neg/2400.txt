There are two words to describe the film. Confusion and hypocrisy. For a battle I only see a chaotic background introduction, chaotic battle scenes, is it so small to win more (I only seem to see that ship led by Li Shunchen is fighting, there are only a few ships directly involved in the battle, and the rest are estimated to be CG) the great victory depends solely on the terrain? From beginning to end, it is the tone of nationalism, which is tasteless. Besides, Li Shunchen didn't die in battle.
