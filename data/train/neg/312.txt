The girl tried to kill her son twice, although the child was born by gang rape by Iranian soldiers, it was also her own flesh and blood, ah, the first time she threw a rope on the mountain and tied her legs in the hope that the child would be taken in by kind-hearted people. when she came home in the evening, she found that the child had been picked up again, and for the second time he directly tied the child into the lake and killed his own child with his own hands, and then committed suicide. It's crazy, I can't watch it at this point!
