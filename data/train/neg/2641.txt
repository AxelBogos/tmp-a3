If it's just boring and unattractive, I can barely give it to Samsung, or at least a film. But the director's own humanistic literacy is really too poor, the plot set to break the Hu Jun knife need to be integrated into the female figure of the "feminine", followed by a group of coy "sissy" scenes, the whole hall laughed knowingly. This is disgusting. That's disgusting. That's disgusting.
