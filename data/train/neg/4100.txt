Oh, come on! Want to find a Chinese starring, and then add some Chinese elements and a few words of Qingdao dialect can come to China to circle money? Really think that the Chinese audience is retarded! It was embarrassing at the beginning, teasing the plot, and Huang was pretending to be Huang no matter what he played, which was torture. What a blind Stallone, a lousy sequel.
