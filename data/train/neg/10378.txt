Since the word "dysphagia" became popular on the Internet, I suddenly feel that many situations in my life can be explained by this. I originally wanted to write an old wet style film review in moments. But the thought of four eyes recommended me to see it. I had to refrain from complaining. This kind of comedy is really embarrassing. I never find it funny. What to do? I am a woman who is difficult to please.
