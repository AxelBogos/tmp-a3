Thanks to Shandong Airlines, thank you for flight SC4884, thanks to the people who arranged the program on this flight, successfully refreshed the lower limit of the score of the movie I have seen in Douban (the last time was in 2014, it was a havoc in Heaven Palace [4.2]), let's talk about this movie: 1, the plot: mediocre, watching one minute can guess the content of the next minute, is it not cool to force the mother and child drama? 2. Villains: more stupid than the aliens throwing C4 explosive fleets in the "Super Battleship", launching dozens of missiles. Do you think you are launching Shenzhou X? 3. Sensational: even if the protagonists read the main theme lines, they even add a narrator to promote the main theme. I am really speechless. Rhythm: those shootout scenes made me feel like I used to play live CS. 5. Acting skills: the facial expressions of the male hosts are not as rich as those of the news anchors. To sum up, there are two words: Bull shitters!
