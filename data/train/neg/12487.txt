This is the worst movie of Uncle Dongmu in recent years, isn't it? the thrilling and tender card of the psychic's dialogue with the dead is really unskilled, but Uncle Dongmu's unique skill is to find another way to dispel the original genre elements of the film (millions of babies are inspirational, the dream of the corridor bridge is an extramarital affair), and this confluence of the three lines does not bring any fresh angle or depth, bloated and unassailable stitching. Unfortunately, it was reduced to a gimmick.
