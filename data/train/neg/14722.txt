Wasted a story, except for the duckling, everyone's acting skills are not desperate, interspersed with stiff rhythm, the background and atmosphere are not in place, the overall tone is not harmonious â€¦... It would be nice to make a little more effort to create a world like Silver Wing (the standard is too high).
