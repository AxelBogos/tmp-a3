It really sucks. I don't know if the writer's head was kicked by a donkey! When the police couldn't beat the gangs, they asked Batman for help; the gangs didn't do their "business" and found a clown to endorse them, and a few Chinese came out inexplicably, which was disgusting! Watching this two-and-a-half-hour movie is a waste of time!
