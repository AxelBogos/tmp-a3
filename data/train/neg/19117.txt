I still like some of Feng Xiaoning's movies. At that time, I was very happy to see the first movie with my hands up. But the second part, on the one hand, is that the joke is so childish that it takes the audience as an idiot. In addition, making such a film is neither ironic nor black humor, or stupid words that have occupied our Japanese army for eight years. What's the point?
