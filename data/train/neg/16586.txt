I saw it in the world problems class. Watch me fall asleep; you can ask me to convert to Christ, or I can sing hymns some week, but Allah is in my heart; if you are cut off from it in the newspaper, who knows if your heart is still here?
Allah! I pray you, give me the strength to see through the heart of the heart, or let me pursue, serve you around, talk to forget the differences between the hearts of the people!
