I saw it many years ago, but I didn't catch a cold. I saw it on Netflix today. I didn't recognize the name. I played it again. It's really not that ugly. There are so many mouths inside, blunt lens switching. It's not easy to arrange a good subject like this. You can still get an Oscar for the question. There is no denying that actors and directors have done well elsewhere. But this one is really not good. Let's just say the Oscars are a bigger problem. It's going to be dark all my life.
