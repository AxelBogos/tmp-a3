Did not expect "Dawudang Heaven and Earth Code" unexpectedly imitated "Kung Fu Panda", but the plot is inexplicable, it is purely made up. The behavior of the characters was absurd and illogical, and the flood of slow motion led to the weakness of the action scene. Yang Mi unexpectedly said twice, "our Yin Sutra has been stolen. I think your Yang Sutra has also been stolen?" Childish lines + mentally retarded plots + soft actions are nonsense at all! Must ask little Xu Jiao to go on a blind date, but also represents, your whole family is the representative!
