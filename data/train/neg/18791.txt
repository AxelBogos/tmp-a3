I watched it for half an hour the night before and the pace was too slow to give up. Today, I held the expectation of an 8.6-point movie and the expectation highly recommended by my college girlfriends. I stared patiently for more than two hours, but there was no answer! There is no answer! I'm going crazy! I can't appreciate any art or shooting techniques. I want answers! I want to know who did it!
