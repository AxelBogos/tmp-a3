Low-level film aesthetics, poor directing skills, the overall texture is completely a TV movie, or a relatively ordinary kind. Three hours of plot length is unrestrained, do not leave blank and aftertaste any chance, do not see how many real feelings, only constantly sensational music and tears. As for the voluntary repentance of the bad guys, the plot that the good guys and the bad guys end up hugging each other and understanding each other is stupid, especially when it comes to one of the most evil policies in human history, I can't figure out what a director would want to do when it comes to hillbilly.
