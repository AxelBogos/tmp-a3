The movie is very good, to evaluate objectively, I will give it a score of 7.5-8, but I really don't understand that Americans gather to interpret redemption after driving a sports car to swim on the beach, but this is a far cry from the freedom of the soul, and this ending is not worthy of such praise. I'm here to bring down the GPA.
