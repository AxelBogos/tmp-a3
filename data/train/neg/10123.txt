European and American film Japanese Fan-repression. This is a standard Douban movie, literary and artistic young people flock to it. Once the pain occurs, it must be kept in your heart forever, and then expressed slowly and restrained in a two-hour movie. Of course, you can't cry bitterly, otherwise how can you be a literary youth? It must be a loss of face all the time, it must be a kind of frigidity that no one can tease. I don't deny that there is pain that can't be overcome. I just think this film is deliberately hypocritical.
