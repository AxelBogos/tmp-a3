The inspirational film of a business idol feels like an old dress has been refurbished. The lineup is strong enough to be full of favorite actors. If these actors don't stay here but change their faces, no one will watch it and don't feel enthusiastic and inspirational. The drama of Youjiang almost made me forget my love of knot. I saw a film review saying that the protagonists of western films are the best at the beginning, while the protagonists of oriental films start in full low mode. Western films win the world and lose themselves, while oriental films find themselves and give up the world.
