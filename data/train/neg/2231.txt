What is the style of touching gold? Just pretend that all those rituals and slogans are gold style? It feels a lot like those voices that "thorough materialists are fearless". Doesn't the director know that only the unusual in the ordinary is the most real? Shu Qi's acting skills in this film are not as natural as Angelababy, forced to take off, a mouth goose bumps, the three leading actors except Huang Bo are in that concave shape, see physical discomfort, ruined.
