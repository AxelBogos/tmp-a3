Great, according to the year, the movie mentioned in my hometown can at least be found first, not the one that has changed during the Spring Festival. The title of Xu Anhua's "Golden Age" at least singles out the heyday of spirit in the midst of vagrancy. Xiao Hong can only say that Xiao Hong is red in this one. Ups and downs, all with the legend itself step by step, scattered beads, but can not wear a sufficiently moving emotional thread. Only after a while, reading the pen and ink of the literati at that time, decadence and grief and indignation were wild, fascinated and afraid. With so many men coming and going, only his grandfather really loved her. Lu Xun really understood her. Xiao Hong writes because there is nothing happier to do. In the end, what she can't let go of is the fear that her work will be deleted. Is it a real literati? Song Jia and Tang Wei are very similar in some angles. when the train bid farewell, Huang Jue integrated the looks of Huang Xiaoming and Huang Xuan. Two and a half stars.
