The first time I knew that "the first intimate contact" was to listen to Lu Yuenong's radio program "it's not too late tonight". It was recorded into a radio drama. The heroine was probably Wu Fang or Kangkang. Her voice was very nice and moved. I bought a book. I imagined the heroine to be very beautiful in both the radio and the book. How could a story be so bad?
