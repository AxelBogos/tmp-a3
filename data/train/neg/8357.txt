Such a low-cost, mentally retarded and incompetent romantic comedy is a dead one. Can't write good stories, can't come up with good ideas, can't create new types of Chinese romance films that can't broaden, and doesn't help China's backward industrialization. If this group of untalented creators put all their minds on this kind of film in the future, it will come true if they have been dumped by South Korea for ten years. In this era when the media have the right to speak, it is so righteous to still use the paragraph of throwing eggs.
