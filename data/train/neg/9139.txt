The plot has been mentally retarded from the very beginning. How could a high-profile Reality Show survival challenge show be slaughtered without first discovering that the so-called mountain people actually have the same home as human beings and have all kinds of daily necessities? how did you get these things? Now that we can get it, we will not be far away from human civilization. how can a family of mountain people avoid the sight of human beings? The plot of 1-6 movies is not nonsense. There are 6 such bad films. I really want to beat up the screenwriters and directors.
