This movie. I just have one word: are you tm teasing me?!
The special effects are too bad and fake, especially in the part of air combat, the camera is still shaking, my eyes are dazzled, and people can't tell.
The performance is bad, perfunctory, and not bad (I like Fan Wei and Zhang Fan very much), but it doesn't matter. under this script and production, it is all pasted into a pile of rubbish, and the English dubbing is too bad to match the mood, expression and tone of the actors. Super acting, the late stage is too useless, the protagonist's Putonghua has not been wiped clean.
A hammer in the east and a hammer in the west, inexplicable, messy, logical? It doesn't exist.
I don't know anything about military. is it ok without a lid on their plane? Only a small bullet hole hit by a fighter gun? The truck is on the side?
