"Anti-Corruption Storm 2" does not change the decline that has already been shown in the first film, the jumping story and more action drama, it just makes its anti-corruption point more difficult to get into the truth, just like Louis Koo's sentence "inconvenient to reveal" in the movie, this is indeed a gimmick that is not worth revealing.
