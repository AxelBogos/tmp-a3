Since someone compared him to Captain America?! Waste an hour and a half on this boring and unemotional narrative to convey the values of the moviegoers? Rehabilitation of veterans is difficult to tolerate a normal society?! How should a single father perform his duties?! Wild survival skills and how to live with loss of face?! It's rubbish. If, in principle, the director is tm who wants to tell the story of mourning B, it is not as good as Manchester 1/10000.
