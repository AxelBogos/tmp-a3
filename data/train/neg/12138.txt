This sequel is like the first dogtail sequel, although it continues the style of the first film, but the plot and picture are not as good as the first one. There are too many shootout scenes. Do you think you are shooting a live CS? However, the idea that "one person in the team will die and the other will die" is quite constructive. Apart from this, there are no other advantages.
