A very stupid and incompetent production. First of all, the typical Big Brother in Hollywood thinks that he starts the project when it is profitable, but does not think about the ethical issues related to filming ("although the influx of refugees mainly affects Europe, but we in the United States can also take a picture of it"). Secondly, the analogy to the "World Trade Center" is too obvious, not only to reproduce the pain and exaggerate the emotion, but also to convey the sublimated value of hope, but also to reflect and criticize the democratic system. In fact, all aspects are floating on the surface (the most terrible is because some kind of "restraint" can not feel violence or emotion, but still has no reflective attitude). Not realizing that the most fundamental flaw is that it makes no sense to confine the whole story to a personal perspective (Stone made the same mistake), and the smartest of such films is the Elephant. Finally, we can feel that these people on and off the screen are still clinging to the existing values of "democracy". The Rightists feel naive and the red left feel narrow. Sure enough, the "white left" despises the bottom of the chain. PS: if there is anything in the world that can be compared with despotism, it is democracy.
