Does it mean that the mention of "the confusion of youth" in the movie is equivalent to "the combination of two men (one thin and one fat) and a woman + riding the train + drinking and smoking + messy in the wind + squinting in the sun"? This kind of formalism, which is unwilling to use any brains to observe life, applies mechanically and does whatever it takes, which is unbearable to me. The details worth pondering, the shocking pictures and the so-called acting skills could have been a good book.
