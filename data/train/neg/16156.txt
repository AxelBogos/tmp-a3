14.7.18 when I went to the cinema with my parents, my sister and aunt, I saw a ghost movie in the cinema for the first time, and I was ready to be scared to death. As a result, the scary point was just the sudden super-loud sound effect that scared people to death. Other places that were not scary, the plot was just a summary of the word reincarnation. 5.4 points
