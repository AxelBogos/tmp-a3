If it hadn't been for the anxious design of the plot, I would have given 4 stars that there are always idiots talking nonsense and wasting time at the critical moment. There is always only the protagonist and no one else can think of it. The Japanese pretended to see nine and a half episodes. I chose to abandon the drama part-time, which is the same thing that insults the audience's intelligence.
