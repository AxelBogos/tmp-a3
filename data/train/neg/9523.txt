In short, the Indian version of the hand tore the devil. After dinner, I want to have some leisure life. When I walk into the movie, I find that it looks like a bad movie. The main reason for choosing this movie is Amir. It turned out to be rubbish. As an Indian film, I have only danced twice, but the last one has not been finished yet. It is really inappropriate. The subject matter sucks. I didn't expect nationalism to work in any commercial film.
