What a waste of time! The plot is strange ~ the acting skills are so bad ~ the lines sound like dubbing ~ my sister occasionally looks beautiful ~ the dress I finally chose is so local ~ my sister's head image is 40 years old ~ the lawyer is so cute ~ ~ that way of proposing marriage I like ~ a key and a diamond ring!
