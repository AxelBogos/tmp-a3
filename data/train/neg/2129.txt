SKYLINE created a precedent that can be made into a movie without a script or brain ~ the slow-motion stars all swore in tears to change careers ~ that suspense flashback, Gulong Jinyong was ashamed to throw himself into the river ~ that touching love and tenacious perseverance, Dong Cunrui would drop dynamite and bow down and call it Fleming K! The touching scene of fighting monsters can make people cry. Is laughing ~ in order to avoid the broad masses of people erect the middle finger, I want to have ink, must splash the screen.
