Teammates play opposite each other on both sides, and the emotional line uses the "change of eyes" of South Korean TV dramas. In addition to the progress at the competition level, there is no substantial upgrade in the senses and audio-visual aspects in several competitions. Every time, they can fall and get up and then catch up and even catch up with their opponents, and the desert race even leaks out the CG feeling. Generally speaking, it is better to "fight a fierce battle" than to spoil the theme.
