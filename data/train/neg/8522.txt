1. The hero is a German, but he helps the Jews, not to mention whether it is true or not. First, he is a German traitor. As the saying goes, "if he is not of our race, his heart will be different." The Germans turn to the Jews, but they are all fake!
2. He tried every means to help the Jews at the beginning of the movie. It was so abrupt and illogical.
3. When I saw that the Germans began to slaughter the Jews, I turned off the movie angrily. The Jews were so honest that they only ran in the street, and when their relatives were killed, they hugged and cried. I didn't have any blood at all. Because in reality, I don't know Jews, so I'm not sure. However, according to the smart and capable national characteristics of Jews, it is impossible to be so heartless.
4. I heard that many senior officials in the United States are Jews.
To sum up, this movie is, how to put it, what color do Americans like, green? Then it is often said that the "green movie" is over when Americans are happy. I don't think it is necessary for Chinese people to watch this kind of movie. It is extremely boring!
