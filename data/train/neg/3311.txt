The film is very good, which means that the director is very good. It's just that I simply don't like this type, and the theme only likes the part of real people and true stories. The actors are all good, but Zhao Wei is not dark enough, unlike rural people. Zhang Yuqi is very beautiful, but she has a dead face. When I saw Hao Lei, I was still thinking about the riddle of Fucheng. She gained a lot of weight, but I like her best. There is no ending, which increases the complexity of the event.
