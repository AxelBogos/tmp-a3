Wearing a science fiction coat, I actually wanted to be a literary fan, and it turned out to be a pornographic and violent drama. But at least you can tell me the background. You thought that when you appeared on the stage, you didn't look like a ghost, so I knew you wanted to talk about the future. And 2096. An ancient Egyptian god doesn't want any woman. If you have to find a tangled episode, you don't even know if you're human.
