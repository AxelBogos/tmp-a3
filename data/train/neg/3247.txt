After watching it in the cinema today, the overall feeling is inexplicable. The story and background are in the second grade than Altman. Introduced a lot of characters abruptly without explanation and presentation. The development of the story is not interesting. The biggest thing about this movie, if anything, is that it exploded. Advice: if there are other movies you want to see, don't watch this.
