The aesthetic appreciation of "tiny Times" is full of lines, scenes, performances and costumes, which are too embarrassing. Cai Kangyong probably thought, anyway, it's just a fan movie. Just shoot a few familiar faces of Kangxi at random. Can't compare with Han Han at the box office and Guo Jingming? He overestimates himself.
