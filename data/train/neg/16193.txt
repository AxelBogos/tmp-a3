This is the story of a bear child who is too shocked to laugh: he runs a funeral home with his seventh uncle, who is fascinated by the undertaker, and falls in love with a girl with "HS" tattooed on her arm, and the girl leaves with a boy with "YJ" tattooed. I'm not happy to have a good time. At first it was scary, then it was sweet, and finally it was kinship and tenderness, stewing a pot in order to grab more labels and classify them. 2 points roll rough.
