What a handful of 'erosion'! This is the most erosive Wong Kar-wai movie I have ever seen in the universe! Oh, shit! It's just like a hint in the movie-'Damn it, all the memories are fucking wet'! In this film, Wong Kar-wai, really did it, from beginning to end, wet! Even every picture, can flow out of the water! Oh, fuck! How rotten your mother is! It's like getting gynecological disease-cervical erosion in general! I'm so impressed! Oh, fuck! These two points are for all the actors who interpret this film! The performance of the actors is really good! However, the overall atmosphere of this film does have a sense of decadent erosion in the underground nest! Or, more accurately, the vaginal self-dialogue! Or is the dialogue between penis and vagina! Fuck! This also corresponds to the picture of the tree hole at the beginning and end of the film-just like a vagina! Fuck! The taste is really unusually low! Fuck! Fuck
