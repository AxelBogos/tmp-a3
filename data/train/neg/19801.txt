Maybe I didn't watch 3D ~ ~ I don't feel so good ~ soft science fiction was already a thing of the past. The mass base of the cartoon itself is insufficient and the anti-mainstream stir-fried rice must have no future. At the same time, there is a faint taste at the same time. The whole film has no bright spot, world outlook and plot, and primary-age, a science fiction hero film of the last century ~ although it is in the era of visual blockbuster, it can not enrich the eyes. Waste your brain!
