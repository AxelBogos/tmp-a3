An old-fashioned story with nothing new at the end. Shawshank's redemption, in addition to enduring humiliation and stealthily living in order to escape, did not clear up his grievances. It is a bit excessive to say that it is an inspirational film. If it is the yearning for freedom, anyone who has not been numb in prison for more than 10 years yearns for freedom.
