If it hadn't been for the two leading actors, I wouldn't have seen a 5.6-point movie at all. After watching it, I felt that 5.6 was too high for no reason. The father kills the son, the son also wants to cross the father. The plot is too slow and too simple! And what are the two leading actors trying to express, one getting married and the other divorced? I think the bride was so aggrieved when Zhang Zhilin got married, and the result must be the same as that of Wu Zhenyu.
