Ferocious real estate agents, declining Cantonese opera, Hong Kong youth, self-mockery and overly straightforward positive energy of all kinds of chaos are not so much a mix-up as a Hong Kong-style northeast stew, visual, action, and narrative are all confused, and all their acting skills are misled by Wan Ziliang. even if posted on the local icon, it is still an extremely disappointed work of primary-age. Ambition and talent are always two different things.
