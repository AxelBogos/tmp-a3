A very bold and arrogant attempt. When watching the film, I felt that the male lead's manipulation of love was disgusting. He thought it was a straight male cancer writer / director who unscrupulously revealed it, but the screenwriter turned out to be the female master. no, no, no. no, no, no. I'm really speechless.
