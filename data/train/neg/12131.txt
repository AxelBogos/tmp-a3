There is nothing wrong with living a peaceful and peaceful life, with people who love you and intimate companions. Don't wait to lose it to cherish it. After losing it, I understand that it is profound, but no one can be sure to start all over again, just like the ending of the story. The time of fighting, quiet happiness. The world without language is just as splendid and full of emotion. (2015)
