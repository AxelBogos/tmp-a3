There is no sense of substitution at all. I don't know what the director is trying to say. Killing the Germans doesn't feel good at all. On the contrary, it reminds me of the scene in which the Japanese soldiers wantonly slaughtered the infantry of the national army with armored vehicles. What a hero to kill a prisoner, no feeling. Germans are faceless, inhumane, unbloody and unreal. One point, let's go.
