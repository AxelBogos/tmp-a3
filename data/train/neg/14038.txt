There is no laughing point in the whole process, the stalks are very low-level and naive, what fell to the ground and so on. It made me realize that cartoons are ultimately for children. Then I began to worry about watching such boring children's animation with my children in the future, instead of cats and mice full of wisdom and real humor. Finally, my 3D glasses were broken, and I didn't bother to go out to change them. I was naked and finished without obstacles. 95% of the plot didn't need 3D.
