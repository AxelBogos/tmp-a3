The voice of Batman and the Joker in the Batman Arkham series is the same as that of the Knight of Arkham. But this story is so outrageous that the bat wants the clown to cooperate with him? This is not in line with Batman's consistent subjective thinking. Batman hates criminals because it is a criminal who kills his parents, but he never crosses this line. However, in this film, it is said to cooperate with criminals, which is completely contrary to the original character.
