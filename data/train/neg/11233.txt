Chinese people have no sincerity in making this kind of disaster and human nature film. Science fiction is naive enough to go back 50 years, and you can know what will happen after the introduction, but you are still disgusted by the details. The inferiority shown in it is far greater than human nature. Wang Baoqiang is like a popular young player. This is not as good as the anti-flood film that fought and sacrificed for socialism. No, not even close.
