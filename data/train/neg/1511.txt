Quentin doesn't think there will be any more breakthroughs. I feel that this film is more nagging than "vulgar novel." it's full of dialogue. I really don't know what people with high scores think. If I see half of it, I can't watch it at all. I may not be able to blend into the history of American English, and I don't know anything about the Civil War, which is equivalent to Americans watching a civil war film full of Northeast dialect and Nanjing dialect written by Zhao Benshan. I don't think I can understand it.
