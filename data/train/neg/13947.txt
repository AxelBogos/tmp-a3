The demon appearance and continuation of the stem is very old-fashioned, the acting skills of the actors are very bad, and the atmosphere shaping draws lessons from Wen Ziren's techniques, so it is also OK, but the plot is completely plagiarized "Ghost covers the eyes", nothing new to speak of, even a little stupid, minus one star.
