After reading the novel, I feel that there is some plot background. Otherwise, from the point of view of the film itself, the lines around the story are somewhat stiff, the plot is abrupt and thin, and there is a feeling of expression for the sake of expression. looks like an eight o'clock TV series. The character relationship and plot of the original work are very complex, only a small part of it is extracted here, but it does not deepen the performance of its contradiction, which is really boring.
