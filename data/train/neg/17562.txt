Don't buy a ticket to the cinema. It doesn't look good. The plot is thin, only bgm is online in the whole process. After watching it for 20 minutes, I wanted to leave. When the plot slowly came out, I fell asleep. I was awakened by the sound effect, but I didn't have an egg. I seem to have seen that alien monster.
