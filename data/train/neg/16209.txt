How long have they been doing this for generations? they have not seen that all the trees have been cut down. These belong to others. If you hand them over to the country, why don't they get rich when they are poor? Like in the Dream of Red Mansions, we use the contract system to see who will cut it. He is ignorant and poor, and he talks about human morality even if he doesn't have enough to eat. Human nature is evil. Have the ability to accept but can not bear to take care of, the main theme of my ass.
