Hollywood movies always refresh my expectations of human technology, such as the pervasive penetration of information technology into life shown in the 1998 "Public Enemy of the Nation". The same is true in the first half of the film, but the second half is suddenly transformed into science fiction, all kinds of logic wounds, the plot is unreasonable, even if the picture production is still good, it can not save the fate of being reduced to a third-rate work.
