I quite like the second film, and the first one is fine, but the third one is long and wordy. The hostess finally made up with the wide face with no neck and deducted one star; the cutest Finnick died in such a soy sauce way, could not bear it, and deducted another point. It's finally over! Add one star. Two-star film, no more
