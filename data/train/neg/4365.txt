No matter who shot it, they are treated equally, bad movies are bad movies, students with no acting skills, shooting humble DV works. Where did Xiao Qingxin get such a high score? You can give such bad films as "Guan Yunchang" and "warring States" for one or two stars, but you can't give this kind of fake technology, fake production, fake actors, all four or five stars. Is it interesting? Who are you pretending to see? Anyway, I'll tell you the truth.
