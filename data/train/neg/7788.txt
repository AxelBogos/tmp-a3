Why is the highlight of this movie only Liuyan that pair of giant breasts? There are several constellations that have no interpretation at all! Fortunately, I am a Gemini ~ it is said that the heroine is a stimulated psychopath! Did the shadow of childhood affect you so much? Why did you live so long? If you're going to die, why not kill yourself sooner? Screenwriter! You don't have to worry so much to get them killed! Just find a character flaw and make up a more reasonable scene to die! ~
