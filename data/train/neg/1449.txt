I don't know why, even after more than a decade, I still can't watch it again. The first is that I can't agree with the price view of love in the film, and the story doesn't let me see that the three people really love each other. Gu Cheng's love and tragic ending I can understand, this film does not let people see the emotional entanglement between the three. Does not have any credibility. And even more hate the so-called sexual freedom and openness in France. There is no love sex, like animals. The reason why human beings are human beings is that they should be called human beings only if they have feelings.
