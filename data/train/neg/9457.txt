In the first year of junior high school, I sang opera in my hometown and starred in this film. I heard that many shots were blank-this was also one of the official simple and rude ways to deal with it at that time. Later, I saw that this film was mentioned in Ba Jin's "random record", saying that it was not porn. I saw VCD on Tianshengqiao's computer, but I didn't see any pornographic scenes. I cut it off completely. Now it seems that this is a literary joke in the early days of reform and opening up, as well as nude photos of nude female models. Prison break saw the cut shot, not too yellow, alas, far from the Japanese av actress.
