After watching the first bad movie of the new year, I felt that it was ruined in the morning. I have never seen a movie in which I feel so good about myself (I don't know if the narrative skills will be better if I haven't seen the original novel). As soon as she appeared on the scene, Duko Maeda knew that this woman was deceitful, and a small half could guess the whole plot. Of course, if the process is wonderful, I can still gladly accept it, but the point is that the whole story is too bad for people to bear.
