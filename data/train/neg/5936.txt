The director is terrible, the camera is all the same as the TV series, all the characters are in close range, the seats are not changed, the problem is that it is not reasonable to jump the axis. The editing also has no logic, the transition is stupefied, the dubbing is not good, the plot is driven by the lines, and the audience is not blind. Not to mention the special effects, it's only 80 cents. Is the soundtrack an uncopyrighted score found in the library?
