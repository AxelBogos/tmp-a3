It's too far from what I thought, so it's only two stars. The pace of the film is a little maddening. The whole article is full of hypocrisy, only impressed by two places, one is that two people speak to other people's mouths, and the other is Tang Wei's speech to her mother in her coffin. It feels like the director is wasting two actors. PS: I can't stand Bonzi speaking English. I obviously have to play with an American accent when my tongue is short. Can you come over?
