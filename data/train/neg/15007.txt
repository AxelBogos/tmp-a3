Do you still remember the movie "1408" before these two protagonists? Also Stephen King, this time turned the original thick book into a mediocre zombie play, many wonderful scenes are really wasted, the director has no talent and storytelling ability, the protagonists are also careless to bear the shock, but also hard work.
