The old lady's foot-binding cloth is smelly and long. I was a little sick at the end. To be honest, Tim Burton's movie stories are too unreadable. His films either have more dark and melancholy pictures, or have more fantastic and bright colors, or the pictures are beautiful. The story is really not very exciting.
