I didn't understand it from beginning to end. After reading other people's comments, I know that the whole story has something to do with Christianity and the Bible. The whole film has very little dialogue, some pictures are very lengthy, some are changing all the time, and there are all kinds of strange things, anyway, I don't know what it is. The tempo is so slow that it takes a lot of patience to finish it. The obscurity is too deep, it is said that you can think about life from a philosophical point of view, but it is too deep for me.
