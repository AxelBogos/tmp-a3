Dad eats for two stars. Cute to nosebleed T T [in fact, the role of "Angel" is awkward for anyone to play, Mary Sue, and that kind of uncomfortable affectation-try to replace Joe Black with chicken wings and think about fear. Still need the actor's personal charm ~ it's brilliant to be young and cute ~
