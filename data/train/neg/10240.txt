There is a ghost relationship with Frankenstein, pain and despair give birth to Frankenstein, but only to see the pain of the clumsy and bloody description, ask Ellie Fanning to match a few chapters to convince the audience that it was written by marry shelley? Not to mention that if this is a good script, I would be so mad that I would like to drag Ellie Fanning out for a beating. I think the micro-expression she is performing now is extremely suitable for the heart bitch under the peony flower, playing such a strong-willed, gentle and kind character, who can believe it?
