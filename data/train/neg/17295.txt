As usual, I don't comment on the plot, but I have to admit that the beautiful women in India are really beautiful and have a good figure. (personally, I think that in terms of the same legends, the degree of horror, cruelty and blood is not as good as the disaster of wild pythons, and some parts are disgusting. )
