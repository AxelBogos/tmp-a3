In the future, this little brother Neil will no longer watch his works, just like District 9, he has a good idea, but the world outlook and character setting are too retarded, the plot twists and turns and the motivation of the character's behavior are unreasonable, but bluntly according to the director's purpose, the sensational part is even more embarrassing. The role of Uncle Hugh is the most retarded. Why would he take such a movie, ðŸ™„?
