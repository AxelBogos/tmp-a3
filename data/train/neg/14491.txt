Flying over the Home for the elderly is basically a movie that does the wrong thing with good intentions. Empty and powerless, indecisive in the small fresh and tough wind. Emotion is basically driven by music, and the plot is basically driven by fantasy. It is recommended to watch the trailer. You can't fast-forward in the cinema, sitting on pins and needles.
