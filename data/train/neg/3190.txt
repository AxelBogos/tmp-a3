The plot lost its wits. Liang Jiahui is too old to play the King of Thieves. When the prototype died, he was only over 40. Although he had tried his best to perform, he was still too stupid. Not only Liang Jiahui, every character looked like a fool. That rabbit looks like bb ~ I really hate Cui such as bb, because someone will make her a chicken feather. Chang'e looks good in a shoulder padded skirt when tying up Stanley Ho, but that's it. The character, like most of the characters in the film, has a zero sense of existence. The soundtrack is inexplicable, like an octogenarian who has just learned how to surf the Internet to find a rock list made by a young man in a small town, old-school and disorganized. What is more interesting is that Ren Dahua has also played Zhang Ziqiang before, and this time he played the policeman who arrested him (although there is a section in the middle that doesn't know where he is). Zhang Ziqiang's on-screen image is still the best performed by Zhao Yanguo at present, regardless of acting skills or plot arrangement, at least I think so.
