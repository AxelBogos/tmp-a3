Guan old thief is a scourge for 94 and a scourge for 19, and it is hard to hate a paper man for 25 years. I wonder whether the plot of 94 Zhang Wuji watching Zhao Min being turned a blind eye to rape is more disgusting, or is it more disgusting in 19 Xie Lion King's strange treatment of his son's life-saving villain? The four women in the same boat originally referred to Wu Qingying? Watch the spoiler and Xie Lion King to Zhou Zhiruo to block the arrow of the plot, the lion butcher meeting he thundered-bitch! But I remember it vividly in my ears, Guan old thief, you'd better go to your Zhi Ruo to block the arrow. What a pity, like the 19 version of Minmin, big eyes I can also accept, and the actor's "I am Zhang Wuji" Weibo is actually very popular. But I still decided to serve both 94 and 19, and the core of relying on heaven has been changed.
