Playing mahjong, just chatting and not playing cards well is a disrespect for card friends. Thanks to this movie, this is the first Hollywood film with a full Asian lineup in recent years (the last one was the Joy Luck Club The Joy Luck Club,1993). The film is successful from a more westernized background (Singapore) hoping to change the stereotype (not attractive enough) of Asians (especially Chinese). Although it is not caught in (such a mistake often made by Chinese movies) to show a life full of money, it is essentially guided by Western universal values, and subconsciously there are still the settings that Asians "do not know how to refuse". In terms of the cultural heritage of overseas Chinese, the traditions retained in the early years have been different from the current habits. This may also be a question of whether or not to identify with the film. (during the release of this film in the United States, there will be English pronunciation and Chinese subtitles. Chinese are welcome to come to the cinema.
