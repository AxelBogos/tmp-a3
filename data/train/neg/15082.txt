Zhang Yimou is my favorite director, but this one may be too funny. When it comes to connotation, I don't see it; when it comes to innovative narrative techniques, I don't see it either; when it comes to reflecting Chinese culture, it's funny Chinese culture. Pure business. What a beautiful love, I dizzy, really do not catch cold.
