There is no real dispute between the interests of this film, add the details of the first film, at the request of the audience to film A Yan and the psychiatrist, the plot is relaxed and happy, the logic is also confused. After Yang Jinrong took the tape of identifying the mole from the dead A Jen, why he did not directly press Liu Jianming and arranged such an inefficient bureau, it is really incomprehensible. Does Yang know that Liu is schizophrenic and wants to be a good person? Chen Daoming didn't do anything with such a big pomp.
