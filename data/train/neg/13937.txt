The fast-forward and follow-up shot lit up at the beginning, but then it was too mediocre. In fact, the plot of this film is still good. If you change the director of a higher level, you can certainly produce a great work, but Zhao Chongji's idea is that it always feels almost interesting, and the end of the film is very sensational, and the song "Sealed With A Kiss" in the film sounds like "The Sound Of Silence".
