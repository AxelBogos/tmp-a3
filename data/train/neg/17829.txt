It's not a problem to change your character, it's a problem to change to a stereotyped uncle. The author's youth is only reflected in the immaturity of technology, the story lines are full of middle-aged trite everywhere, and the dialogue animation full of broken words in Chinese films can not be avoided. The action is shabby, no sense of attack, no rhythm, all the handsome shots are different from the key points, especially if you can't take out all the sticks and turn your perspective, it's uncomfortable to hold your breath in half.
