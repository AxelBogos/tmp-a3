Perhaps I can not understand, a lonely person lost the most dependent on the dignity of living, why can not choose the end, choose the right to live or die, this is the final dignity. Why does a person who is close to adulthood (American precocious) remain silent when he sees a rule-breaking event? this is conniving at crime. I don't understand the ridiculous logic of the film. This is American values, so I oppose him.
