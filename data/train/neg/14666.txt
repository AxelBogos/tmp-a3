Jimmy came to the theatre to watch his daughter take part in the child star beauty pageant final. The daughter with heavy makeup on the stage suddenly dropped the transparent umbrella and temporarily changed the song. He devised a perfect theft plan, which was also part of his plan to steal the day and wreak havoc in the prison, smash into the shop and turn himself into the trap, and balance all sides without flaws. He designed so many perfect reversals, but not as successful as his daughter for another song. The biggest flaw in life is the hometown road, take me home.
