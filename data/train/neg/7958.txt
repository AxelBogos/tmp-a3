The first minute is full of skiing, watching very confused. Photography in order to expose the picture properly, the actors' ski suits are filled with led lights. I thought it was a ski show, but it didn't feel right 30 seconds later, like a metaphor. Who knew the skier rowed for half an hour (it felt like it would take longer), then suddenly broke the window and became an agent. It's a divine turn. After watching it for less than 20 minutes, I can't remember the slot point clearly. Fortunately, I made an appointment with the girl to touch her thigh. I don't know if she thought the film was too bad or was provoked by me, so she took me to her house to have sex. Thanks for the bad movie üòè.
