Let's put it this way, except for Shen Teng's movies, everything else is hot. Huang Cailun has become disgusting when I see it. Chang Yuan basically belongs to the type of not watching it. Allen, I hope you don't let me down. I'm a little afraid to watch your movies now. I'm afraid you'll become another Huang Cailun in my impression. Heroes, take good care of your comedies or plays.
