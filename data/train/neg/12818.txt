[strawberry master contest / worst film] is boring. The editing sometimes breaks through the routine, but it is still relatively rusty, there are many and messy shots, and there are few places with ideas. Suspense only belongs to the plot, and what's worse, the suspense on the plot is immediately broken. But the texture of photography is not bad.
