Really JB stupid, Tim Burton, I thought I could not appreciate his pseudo-Gothic style stupid animation, later through this and the previous comparison, I really understand, to believe in myself, this film is smelly and long, but also chicken play through, the film muddy and meaningless, the previous version of the ape planet than simply can not be put together Whether it is the atmosphere created by the plot setting, especially the ending, it is very inexplicable.
