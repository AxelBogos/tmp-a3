He was so overpraised that he looked like he ate a piece of shit, and now he is very angry. I really don't like gloomy, secret and ethereal things. I can't understand the beauty, but only embarrassment, goose bumps and nausea. I like warm and clear sunflowers, like linear thinking, empty and real, bend around everything and float so far. I get angry when I see the woman talking. I also want to talk about garbage after watching the film review. I just don't like it. I don't like it.
