After a lot of pauses, I finally watched it driven by my obsessive-compulsive disorder. I don't see anything touching at all. People who are full of lies are not qualified to talk about love and being forgiven and forgiven. I'm afraid the tears they shed can only make people feel hypocritical. Jim Carrey is still old. EWAN is cute enough, but the gay actor is still awkward.
