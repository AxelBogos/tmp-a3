Whether it is good or not to watch a movie does not lie in the theme (although the theme itself is not new), but in the convergence of the plot / scene. The connection of this film is loose, the love portrayal of the hero and heroine is not in place, and the title The Discovery is not very reflected. It wasn't until the end of the movie that the rhythm of the movie got back on track, and the seascape shooting at the beginning of the film was the only point to see.
