Bad 3D, hard to guess the will of God. Throughout the dense lines, it is difficult to hear DO SO FA LA C, heartless and meaningless. Lap dancing and shooting horses are interesting, but it makes sense in the whole movie. Do you hold a memorial service for yourself? A bunch of Manchu veterans in Beijing beat your father Genghis Khan with a full score as a political metaphor. Do you want to interpret the meaning of this fake thing?
