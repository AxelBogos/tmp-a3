It's a good idea, but there's no surprise, even disappointment. If you compare with THG, you prefer the rhythm of hunger, emotional expression and shooting methods. There are too many loopholes in this detail, but there is no need to be so harsh on the film from 15 years ago. (it's too bloody to scare cry. It's like watching a horror movie. The Japanese are really cruel in their bones, all of which are shown in the movie.)
