Ang Lee has written a lot of works about homosexuality, isn't it? why is this theme so popular among Chinese fans? because it can't be shown, we can't rule out the suspicion that a small number of fans take advantage of the theme. As for the avant-garde, I think this is a film shot in the United States, in fact, the United States is not avantgarde, so in fact, we are backward, not in line with, not how avant-garde the film is. --
