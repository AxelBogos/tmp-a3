If the film is broadcast as a TV movie on CCTV6, I will give it to 5 stars. But as a real film, it is only worth one star, no matter the scene, lens, actor, action, music all stay at the level of TV series, this is its destiny. As for the understanding of martial arts, it only exists literally. What is like a shadow, two women holding sticks easily explode dozens of garbage masters, and not even a positive lens, bad film.
