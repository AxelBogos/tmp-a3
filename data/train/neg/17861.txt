Role positioning is a big problem. Brolin recruits in the first half, and Benicio saves her sister in the second half, which doesn't look like a two-protagonist play.
The play of robbing and saving the little girl had a sense of design, although it didn't work. The soundtrack also continues the previous style.
Benicio woke up with a bewildered look at the timeline of the drug lord's pursuit, and the little boy's admission was also very stiff for the sake of the plot.
