The script is not bad, there are two acting bonus is not bad. But the director was bad, the editing was bad, the rhythm was worse, and I was so bad. The narrative is too messy. Flashbacks are illogical. If you want to recall, insert a memory. If you want to put a time mark, put a time mark. I appeared in the black scene once, and the soundtrack was weakened with the black scene, and there was a psychopathic front and rear scene where the characters were exactly the same. the one who suddenly went black in the middle (and brought in gradually) was obviously missing the material. When people grade the movie, most of them still regard the movie as a story. Filmmakers still have to work hard.
