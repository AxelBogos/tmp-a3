To be honest, I can understand, but frank is out of date, and it's strange to find that I've seen it before, and I don't think it's important to tell the principal in the first place that frank is old-fashioned, arrogant and very troublesome. Frank has been a little bit annoying along the way, especially suicide in someone's hotel.
