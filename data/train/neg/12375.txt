It is scary for Ewan McGregor to act cute with fish-tail tattoos on his face, not to mention that Jim Carrey makes people cross over to the thriller show of "the King of lies", which is disorganized and emotionless, and the most important part is mentioned directly, so it's better to know the prototype story of the movie. As a comedy, it is very boring and sleeps without hesitation.
