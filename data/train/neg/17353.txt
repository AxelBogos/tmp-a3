Textbook-like character relationship setting, I even made up countless magnificent plots in the first 30 minutes, and finally turned out to be such a monkey show. The two godfathers of Zhu Jiang and Zeng Jiang were simply representatives of facial characters, appearing and exiting inexplicably.

The only good thing is that Wu sir is a little less abusive this time.
