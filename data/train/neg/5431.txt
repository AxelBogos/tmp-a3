Really refreshing the height of domestic bad films, Liu Zhenwei finally confirmed that he did not achieve Zhou Xingchi, but Zhou Xingchi achieved him. When the grape is old, hurry up to provide for the aged, and don't come out to disgust the audience. It would be nice to use A Chinese Odyssey to make a picture of him, but A Chinese Odyssey, without Sing Yeh Zhu Yin, is nothing. I really hope that some people will not destroy the classics.
