Is it a comparison between a religious village and a Buddhist temple, whether it is a fence built for yourself or a scene? guards and believers see that they try to avoid facial expression / straightforward expression of this sense of superiority / that the conflict in the film is not caused by two religious sects, but a confrontation between a believer and supreme political power / I don't know whether it's acting or something else, although it has been restrained. Sometimes it still tends to quiet rather than silence.
