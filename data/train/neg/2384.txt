After saving his daughter, the true TM was mentally retarded. In front of him, the invincible man who successively overturned three tough Russian men turned into a man who only knew how to run away with his daughter, but was chased by perverted villains, leaving a good opportunity for the villain to be shot by the policewoman. He only knew how to run with his daughter, and two guns were left on the ground to hunt him down. On the cliff, he let his daughter escape and nearly fell off the cliff. NM Is this still the man before?
