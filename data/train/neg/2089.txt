It is really worrying for the IQ of Chinese anime filmmakers. The animated image of Pleasant Goat (which is not qualified for animation) has been overconsumed, and every year a theatrical version is digging its own grave. Don't let this kind of anti-human and anti-social film erode the children. Spare the abusive adults who accompany their children to the cinema.
