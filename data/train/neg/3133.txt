Well, I'm here to hack. On the first day in Asia, the group came to circle the money again, and the label of pseudo-rock has been affixed to the upper right corner of the group from the beginning. This is the first time I have seen a documentary sold in the cinema as a movie. I really look down on it, and there are a lot of stupid fans. Take a look at the film review, and Nima has a full score. In this way, the score is expected to exceed Shawshank's redemption. It's a shame to take it out. Theo, Douban how more and more.
