Harry Potter meets the Ghost! It is obvious that Harry, who has grown up to look like a tender cow, is not as professional as SPN's Wen Jia Shuangxiang, and can't even deal with a mere female ghost. I really hate the surprising sound effects after seven or eight years of learning magic. I poked my hand while watching a film while I was embroidering cross-stitch! ╭ (╯ ^ ╰) ╮
