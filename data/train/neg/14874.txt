It's kind of interesting to externalize, self-replace, integrate, like Conanberg's thing in a certain period, although the lighting is infinitely extra, but I don't know whether it's a difference between a scene or a service scene. If the former is terrible, the story is bad, the center of gravity is unstable, and the peaceful and minimalist segment chosen from this perspective tells the most intuitive problems that make the whole film feel thin. It is the explosion at the end that makes it feel like I can't lift my breath. The bug is too deadly.
