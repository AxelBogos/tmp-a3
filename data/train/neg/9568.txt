There are too many troughs in this show, fans should not think that the audience is harsh, the director of the last remake of word-of-mouth is good, this difference is their own problem, don't dump the audience all day, the play that never dumped the audience will not be recognized by the audience. What else do you say that it will look good after the xx episode, why should people insist on watching it from the very beginning, and which good play has an ugly beginning and a good later?
