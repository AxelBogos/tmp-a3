The story of a windy woman and three men (honest and deep shepherd, gentle middle-aged tuhao, unruly red soldier), the plot is better than South Korean TV series, the two spare tyres actually become friends because of the same fate. The only surprise was the shooting. However, the scene selection and soundtrack are excellent. I like the harmony singing part at the dinner party.
