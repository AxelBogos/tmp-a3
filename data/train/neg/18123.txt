Yes! The end is coming, and all mankind is infected, so it is necessary to study the antidote, but the method is not very humane. The protagonists did not want to be human flesh and blood bags, so the protagonist took his friends to start the journey of running. Just leaving the maze to fight zombies is not very fun, except for the protagonist, the sense of existence of other characters has also plummeted, probably the focus has been spent on special effects. After opening the world outlook, I found it completely boring! I don't really want to watch the third movie, ★★☆.
