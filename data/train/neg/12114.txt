Two hours in the cinema was driving me crazy. I felt that the director absolutely had a deep misunderstanding about the painter. The behavior of the characters and the conflicts between the characters are inexplicable. From the sensational part, we can see that the director wants to work hard, but the force is not on the point at all. And the "painting" in the whole movie looks too clumsy, can't you go to the art micro-spray? Now they all look like fake paintings bought by the painter's village.
