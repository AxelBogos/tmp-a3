Hey. Warfare. Give a star because it is an animation based on World War II. The girl in the film is indeed cute, and the ending is really touching, but to investigate the root cause of the war, it is the Japanese who lift a stone and drop it on their own feet. If we had not invaded other countries and attacked Pearl Harbor, we would not have been caught in the war. You say, why am I moved by this movie?
