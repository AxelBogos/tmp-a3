No matter how hard jolie works, this film can't stand such a bullshit plot. The United States and Russia can be played like this by a woman, and then it's for personal reasons? it's neurotic. In the end, what was she going to do if she wasn't trying to kill the president of the United States? It seems that no one told her that there was another one in it, which was inexplicably illogical. Hey, I'm crazy again. I have nothing to do. Come and see this movie.
