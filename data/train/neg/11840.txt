I dare not comment too much. I can only say. I've never been to hell. Don't use hell as the subject matter to make movies. Special effects can only deceive children. Use hell as the subject matter to forcibly sensation. It is estimated that it will mislead a crowd of people. In this way, it is estimated that the staff in hell will have to do a lot of unnecessary explanation work.
