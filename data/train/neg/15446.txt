I know all the truth. I want to see models tear each other. I also know that I didn't expect much plot when I went out and turned left to watch "America's next Top Model." however, it is empty to say that "gorgeous" is empty and does not buy it. It's not just a few lamp tubes and a few mirrors strobe electronic music has aesthetics, ah, even if you look at it visually, I don't really think how far Rivern has gone. I know I just don't accept his aesthetic subjectively. no, no, no.
