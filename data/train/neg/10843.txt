neither fish nor fowl. It's a comedy but full of strange unnecessary narrations that mess up the rhythm; it's a biography but it's full of loser-like fairy tales. The narrative style is not to my taste, and the humor on the other side of the ocean is not my tea. I watched it on and off for four times before I barely finished it, that's all.
