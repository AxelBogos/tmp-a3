As the son of MiyazakiHayao, who first tried to supervise the work, I don't know why he operated on such a heavy original work. From the perspective of the original work, as long as it is unable to carry a large amount of information of the original animation material, it is the palace himself, and spent a lot of energy to transform into their own style, the consequences are probably unimaginable, not to mention a newcomer. Ghibli worked very hard in terms of production, although the results could not be recognized.
