Andy Lau really has no kung fu foundation, simple posture and ugly posture. He plays a punk who gets hurt before the enemy fights and is taken care of by a woman when he can't take care of a woman, but the choreographer arranges the princess to throw herself at him-one of the most failed characters in Hong Kong films. The location is not bad.
