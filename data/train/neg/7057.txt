I have seen a lot of dull literary films, and this is the only one that feels difficult to accept. what is the reason why the roof goes back to the past? What is the colorful light on the wall? A ghost with superpowers can't take out a note in the wall all these years? No matter how subtle, exquisite and deep your emotional processing is, it can't move me if it's all based on hard logic. The second brush, after breaking up, cried like a fool.
