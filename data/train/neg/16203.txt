Characters, stories and other clues are very old-fashioned, it is very strange that such a story dragged on for two hours, the rhythm is too bad, originally very chewy "black tiger gang" three evil tigers this point will be very good, it is a pity; action drama â€¦... Nothing new; lines. I really want to see this piece blindfolded.
