I remember that when I was a freshman or a sophomore in high school, Lao Miao said to me after watching this film: it was as disgusting as eating a fly. So today, I texted him immediately after watching this film: it was as disgusting as eating a basket of flies. Frank Miller pretended not to be forced to be fucked, the Spirit let you take a live picture of the Red napkin, how can you TM the original work of the great god Esna!
