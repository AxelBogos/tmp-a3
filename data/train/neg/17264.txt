This story is made up of several MV passages. Singing and dancing revived, but I was really on pins and needles for more than an hour in the cinema, and the American Dream was too easy to realize. And for their own dreams, let a group of people work hard for themselves but implement differential treatment, only after the light fades to know who is sticking to it. By contrast, the bespectacled commentator in the story is quite likable, and the world certainly needs an intoxicated audience, but also a forever disgruntled bystander.
