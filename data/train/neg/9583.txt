I feel that the picture of Chinese style is very good, and the screenwriter's brain is really big, which is very suitable for children to watch. Many plots can be guessed according to routines. People who turn beans into people who are motivated to do tofu can't understand it, so what's the difference between this and the villagers eating ants and monkeys in the Great Protection Law? they always feel scared when they think about it carefully. Some of the logic of this film is also a little random.
