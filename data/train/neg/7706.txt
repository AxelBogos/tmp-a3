I was sleepy after watching it, and both of them were looking forward to the end soon. The one in the back row is currently taking his son to see it, so numb, are you sure this film is suitable for 8-year-old children to watch, and what's more, do you think it's really good for you to explain the plot loudly to your son in public?
As for the film, there are no surprises, the plot is old-fashioned, the special effects are ordinary, and 3D is even more deceptive.
So, if there is no good movie, you might as well go home and lie down together.
