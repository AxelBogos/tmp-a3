This is the so-called follow-up sequel. No matter the characters, scenes or songs can find a corresponding place in the first film, but after so many years, there has been no progress at all. Among other things, there is not a single song that can be used in a musical. The most unacceptable thing is that the brother and sister who had good memories with mary poppins grew up with no feelings for her and even misunderstood her. I wouldn't have helped such a heartless family if I were a fairy.
