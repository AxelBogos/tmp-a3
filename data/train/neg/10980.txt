Chinese commercial films like to create scenarios that are too bloodthirsty, which often run counter to real human nature, and often imply a position similar to mainstream discrimination against minorities (unconsciously), like the hypocrisy of a straight man saying "respect LGBT" and then "I don't care about others, but my son can't." So don't blame me for complaining: go to hell.
