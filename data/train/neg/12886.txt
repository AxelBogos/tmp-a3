I don't even bother to create the label Indonesia. If I hadn't seen the most powerful blockbuster, and if I hadn't seen Douban's high score of 8.0, I wouldn't have seen this one. The action design is unreasonable, the plot is unreasonable, the problem that can be solved by gun is solved by hand, and the problem that can be solved by intelligence is solved by violence. The Hong Kong film dumped him a few blocks.
