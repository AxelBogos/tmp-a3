What a stupid movie. A cheap venture capitalist keen on an one-night stand, a depressed Martian extinct good man, and fell in love with a vulgar material girl who seemed to be independent and thought she was elegant but rotten in her bones at first sight. and determined to offer gold worshippers to swing over and over for several years, and finally chose the one with bigger diamonds. PS: the best actor in the film is the frog.
