The messy script and chewy rhythm make people drowsy. There is no perseverance after watching it three times. After fast-forward, the story is rotten, there are a lot of technical problems, and there are many characters, but there is not a three-dimensional character. It can be seen that the director is so fooled that he can make a cop and bandit who needs blood eat and film so mediocre, that there is no scene, no love, and the character's motive is still so stupid. It's an audio-visual disaster hodgepodge.
