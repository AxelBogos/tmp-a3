As soon as Europa appeared, I observed the production of this film from a certain perspective. But this film is a complete Hollywood taste in terms of image and action, only the screenwriter's ability is very similar to the tuberculosis effect caused by the French being unable to connect with the American style, especially the soundtrack is impotent.
