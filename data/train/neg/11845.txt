I don't understand why the score is so high. What's so good about this piece? is it like the composition of the college entrance examination / 3D or something? in this era of 3D flooding, can we have some success / after watching the fantasy trip of shepherd teenagers in the afternoon and see this at night? it's enough to be abused by two similar boring stories / isn't the last truth just a case of Bentham's utilitarianism?
