First of all, I am Zhong Hanliang black, but he is the protagonist, deducting one point; second, I am the original party, so I actually changed the original work, deducting one point; third, is it really okay for the so-called beautiful women to be so ugly? another point is deducted. Even Tian Tian can't make me give any more points. I'm too simple and honest to be a loyal man.
