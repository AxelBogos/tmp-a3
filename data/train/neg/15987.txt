Lin Lingdong's comeback, but it is a pity that it can only be summed up as "a bunch of no bright spots". The lineup is not luxurious, but none of the actors in the film show their acting skills are also very good, the story is very general, the heroine is only responsible for silly white is not sweet, the main contradiction is not that the brothers are too good, only blame Taiwan gang is too stupid ~ ~
