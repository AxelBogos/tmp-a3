I can't even give two stars to my goddess movie. Korean drama-style movies, the overbearing president falls in love with your plot, an embarrassing soundtrack, plus the inevitable scenes of rich girls grabbing love, inheriting family business, jumping off buildings for love, and so on. How empty a person can make such a movie, using the theme of the last century.
