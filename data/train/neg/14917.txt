Without the thriller brought by them jumping and jumping as soon as they came up, but the unpleasant story is also quite smelly and long, flashing back to the crime scene can be repeated at a stroke. I hope that the fierce detective will play a strong role in promoting the incident after coming out, but it doesn't seem to be either. I was forced to pick up a scapegoat at the end of the fast-forward look. I don't understand why the score is so high. Who can tell me about it?
