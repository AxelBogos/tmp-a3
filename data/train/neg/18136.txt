Norton is beautiful. I thought Tim Ross was Dr. Ross, that look was really subversive, and he was so old and walking around. The villain finally withered for no reason. The plot is simple enough to compare with gravity. Hulk is really Yao Ming, dare you look better. The spiritual connotation has been weakened a lot. Female two is much better than female one, scriptwriter. if only you let female two show up in the back. It shows once again that humans have always been dragged down by pig teammates. The fight on campus is awesome from 2013 to 248.
