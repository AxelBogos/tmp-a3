Does a successful dragon chase need to rub hot again? Hong Kong actresses don't even have a qualified vase, so they have to have plastic surgery and can't see who is who. The case is too general, Louis Koo is a little paralyzed, Lin Jiadong's supporting roles are as bright as ever, Leung Ka-fai and Ren Dahua are a little old and different, Hong Kong films are really empty, and it's a bit awkward to force a mainland actor.
