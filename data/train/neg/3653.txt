The whole family is happy and dear to the family. I am blind and pitiful, so you have to score high. As far as the film itself is concerned, it is deliberate, artificial and tasteless. If you want to express something coyly, you don't have the ability to express it. You can't express it. On the contrary, it makes people feel very different. One star is only for that poor but hard-working blind man.
