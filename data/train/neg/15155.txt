Very disappointed, feel sorry for the burning. I thought it would be better than burning when I won the prize, but it just made me deeply aware of the patience, restraint, thinking and insight under burning. In contrast to this film, the logic is not established, the characterization is superficial, the plot is stacked only for the final dramatic tension, and there is no subtext for each action to taste and touch. I understand that this is a commercial film, but it is also possible that I am really slowly taking the initiative to see a good film with more efforts, rather than such a lazy film. But the interior design inside is still very beautiful. Especially the living room and kitchen.
