Like the couplet 2, it has committed the shortcomings of too many characters, the villain's lack of personality, and the character's abrupt character. The characters of Magneto and Magic Girl, which were well laid in the first two songs, were once again destroyed by the plot of Secondary two. The villain continued to talk and mentally retarded, and in the end, the opening and hanging of the Phoenix made the whole team's battle meaningless. Only fast silver is the only bright spot.
