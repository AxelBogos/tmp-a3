Generally speaking, they simply ignore this kind of film and disdain to comment. The madness of the water army is really unbearable, too chilling, a movie that can not even cut a good trailer can score six points? Don't deceive people with the nonsense that you don't have the right to speak without watching the film, and you won't go to see the lower limit of the show even if you send tickets. I'm so angry.
