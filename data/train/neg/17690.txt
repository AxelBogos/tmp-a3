I don't like it subjectively. Compared with MiyazakiHayao's other films, although it also conveys environmental protection and seeks a balance, but the plot, the character relationship is chaotic, especially in the second half, the arrangement is inexplicable and tiring to watch. The protagonist is also very wishful thinking.
