The movie has been cut pretty much, so if you don't see the original, you may not know what you're trying to say. The protagonists and heroines are well chosen, but the characters who don't like the work look at each other differently because of their temperament. The work itself is indeed a classic, perhaps because of personal reasons, I really feel a little heavy mouth.
