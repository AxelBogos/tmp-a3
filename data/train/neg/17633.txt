The plot is a little thin, and a little stupefied, and many of the plots feel too primary school students.

Originally, I wanted to hear the dubbing of Matsuoka Moyou, but I ran into a national match, but I was not satisfied. Although the girls painted by Jing'ani are stereotyped and carved in the same mold, they are really cute, especially the leg line drawing that I really like ðŸ˜Š.
