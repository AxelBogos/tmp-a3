In fact, it is not so good, and I always do not think that Qi Shaoshang's rivers and lakes and tears of love can not coexist, as well as Wanqing and Gu Xichao always have no intimate behavior, I am very disappointed. This play puts too much emphasis on male loyalty, in fact, there are no such straight men, there are very few. Everyone is infinitely mythical, occupying the mountain as the king, and there is not a good balance between power, martial arts and love, just blindly acting cute.
