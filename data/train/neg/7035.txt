While many scenes and plots tested my logic, I shook my head at Jean-Pierre again. In addition, as far as I know, the real perpetual motion machine in the world comes from a Norwegian artist. And the funny thing at the end of the film really made me unable to complain. So many people praise this film as if they admire a kind of smoke without side effects, for me.
