There is nothing new in the movie, the plot has no impact, and there is no camera. I don't even understand how those 7.9 points are played. Even some people say that they can be compared with Infernal Affairs. What's the difference between this and remaking Jin Yong's TV series every year? just because they've been translated into a foreign language? Both points are on the piano BGM. The procrastination and overportrayal of South Korean TV dramas are really incisive and vivid in this film, and there are not enough words in this film.
