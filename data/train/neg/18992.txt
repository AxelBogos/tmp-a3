What kind of clearance plan is this? the fight scene is terrible. I can't play with the bipartisan struggle between the government and the country. I thought it was a cult style when I saw the trailer. In addition to the several hasty appearances of the cleaners, there was only a conversation of conscience between the virgin. What a good setting, how bad the director had to be to make this film like this. The madness of the trailer makes me expect too much.
