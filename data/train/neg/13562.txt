Disney's Bollywood-style movie is like an American with a discrepancy between his words and deeds, saying that he is in the cosplay Middle East, but his body is dancing hiphop. The most 🐂 b point is that it is clearly using the packaging of Arab culture to tell a black politically correct story around the corner. The composer and choreographer did not care (and may not intend) to understand the long tradition of the fertile crescent soil nurtured by the desert and the Mediterranean, playing rich exotic music. I missed the opportunity that cultural diversity could have been reborn into a classic again.
