. . I took it all. DC is really good at playing every one of his good cards. The best part of the film is, at the end of 3 minutes? Even the end of the film is better than the positive, mom. I can guess the direction of the whole film just after the introduction of the background of the beginning of the story, and it is even more difficult to see the extreme. The age of the protagonist is set to 14, big brother! 14, not 4! As for such primary-age! Except for a few players who can still laugh, there is really no place to watch the whole film.
