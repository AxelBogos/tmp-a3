I was recommended to read the president's speech a long time ago, and finally after reading it, I found that the plot was unreasonable and unconvincing. I'm not interested in commercial films with such a smooth plot. When it comes to special effects, it is difficult to evaluate the amazing technology at that time 20 years later.
