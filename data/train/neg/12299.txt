It is said that the flip card is actually a copy of the localization of the mainland, but whether it is Dillon's reunion with Brother Fage after he is released from prison, or the part of Fage's wine house, this film does not copy the feeling of the classic scene of the 1984 classic film. In addition, the storyline added in this edition feels completely superfluous. Apart from the songs of my brother and John Woo's pigeons, there is really nothing left in this film.
