Selling copies is the most diligent and unfastidious director I have ever seen. One minute can explain a new character plus a turning point. Two shots can solve a conflict as if it had never happened. Is it written by a primary school student?. I have been watching his camera language since I escaped from Clone Island. It can be said that I have not made any progress. Not a minute of the story can stand up to scrutiny, if you give this series a sincere evaluation, it must be a few blind shots!
