I shouldn't have any expectations for a film with Jay Chou. Even Lin Chaoxian, who wanted to rely on Hollywood blockbuster, only saw clumsy and childish imitation and self-righteous ridicule. There is no expectation for the plot, but it is not only too mentally retarded to complain, but also very fragmented. There was no bright spot in the action scene as a selling point, and Nicholas Tse also acted too hard. Looking at the whole film, the most handsome one is an Zhijie.
