As a criminal investigation movie, the whole story did not solve the case in the first 65 minutes and began to solve the case in the last 30 minutes at noon, even though the lines were contradictory and the whole film was made into a ghost film, not to mention the portrayal of the characters. In the original work, the relationship between Lin Tao and Qin Ming did not have a grudge from the very beginning. Qin Ming's serious and fierce character is not contradictory, but it is molded. It's not good at all, it's very conflicting, and the only professional term for the whole movie is ATP, and there's an English daydream star for the original work, the medical examiner in the eggs and everyone on the film crew. Thank you for your hard work.
