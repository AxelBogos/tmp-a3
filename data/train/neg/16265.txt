The director may want to say too much, but none of them is complete. It seems that magical realistic movies are really not my type. So far, the favorite movie of this kind is "the Sun Rises as usual". The little girl's performance was excellent, the film was well received by the industry, and the little girl should be nominated for the Best Actress Oscar.
