The script is so bad that it blinds a few old actors. The front is as light as water, there are no ups and downs of the plot, no thrilling action, as if watching a domestic police series; at the end, from the Doctor to Brother long, there is no logic directly, just to play up the boss image of Longgota, just like the lady of the service industry, the best part for the most wonderful part (fake the most wonderful part), really shameless!
