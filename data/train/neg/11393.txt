It was out of control from beginning to end, fooling around at will, without rhythm at all. Horror comedy is the highlight, zombies, underworld trial, is the feelings of the old Hong Kong film, but this is the end of the plot is really empty, everyone is pompous and pretentious acting, as if forced to go on with the movie. It was awkward all the time, and it wasn't until Shen came out that I began to laugh. In the whole movie, colored eggs are the funniest, especially Tony Leung's facial paralysis!
