An anti-Japanese drama ðŸ˜“ to the devils in the film can live for more than 8 years in China ðŸ˜± is not a few of my favorite movie stars, but watch 3 episodes! And it's all right to fight the devils together, but don't beat down the national army, okay? Was it the immortals who killed hundreds of thousands of devils in several battles in Hunan in the history of the Anti-Japanese War? I can only give you the lowest score, and I recommend friends not to read it! waste time!
