It's really boring. The plot adaptation is a mass of confusion, and after watching half of it, I want to leave, except that there are a few pieces of Lao Chai music that doesn't seem to have much to do with the nutcracker. Sometimes I think I'm watching a low-end version of Alice in Wonderland. I also think that Kayla's grandiose and neurotic character is more interesting, the mouse is cute, and some scenes are well designed. Sister Mackenzie... It is still more Reiki and beautiful in the picture.
