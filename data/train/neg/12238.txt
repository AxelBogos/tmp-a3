In a childish way, the film narrates the story of the Australian people fighting bravely when the Chinese army invaded Australia, trying to show their hard-won peace and happiness and pure small-country chauvinism. In the cinema, you will see a group of stupid Australian men cheering and applauding from time to time when the protagonist kills the Chinese. In order not to let others say that this film is racist, I deliberately put an Asian protagonist in it.
