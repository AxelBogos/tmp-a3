The story reminds me of the literary version of Charlotte, where the man and his wife are gone. Black and white and color settings are really embarrassing, the money has been spent in vain, right? The director is so hard with all kinds of settings that he gets stuck all around. The whole film is covered with music, but it still can't hide the awkwardness of the actors' acting skills.
