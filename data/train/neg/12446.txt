The suspense of this film is too weak. At the beginning, it was introduced that the male master had struggled against death for many years to guess whether he had set a trap for the judge to let him die recklessly. When he debated with the mayor at one and three places and mentioned that there was no case of unjust death, I almost thought that the writer was digging a hole for the audience, trying to guide the big reversal at the end. When day2 found the female partner with leukemia, he made it clear that the card was clear. As a result, it ended without reversal, wasting my 140th minute.
