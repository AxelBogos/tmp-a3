Even if the film review directly upgraded the connotation of the film to the Giant Buddha Xplus and the film itself won various awards, it was still unable to change this perception. It was very boring, like a swing dangling in the same place for a whole hour and a half. The story was simple but without depth, and the portrayal of the so-called rich and poor class was very thin. In order to cover up this thin director, he turned the color into black and white, but to no avail. The rhythm imitates the Japanese movies of the 1950s and 1960s.
