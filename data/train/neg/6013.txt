As soon as the movie was finished, Edwood sighed deeply and said, "well, this is it. History will remember me for this movie." Sure enough, he hit the nail on the head, and with this film, he won the title of "worst director in history". The film also became the worst film made by "the worst director in history", referred to as "the worst film in film history". Film history is the worst. I have to watch it.
