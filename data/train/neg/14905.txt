The ending is desperate and amazing. When I think of the game "Dark Marsh Manor", I thought it was a victory, but in fact, the game has just begun, or finished. The discussion of human nature is not deep enough. I thought a few people would change sex. More of it is a desperate coincidence, like dominoes, people fall one after another.
