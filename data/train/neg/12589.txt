One or two are quite good-looking, like "heavy demons" and "commitment" two stories, the ending is quite crisp & unexpected. Unexpectedly, Uncle Kitamura played this ðŸ˜‚ when he was young! PS. In the past, when I watched "lurking" ("Yin Room"), I thought that the idea of using photos to reflect the distance between ghosts was very wonderful, but now it is very likely that I took the scriptures from "Line of sight", ðŸ˜‚!
