I really can't find the advantages of this film. The rhythm is unknown, the plot is procrastinating, various grooves, deep well ice messy into. Compared with "infecting the islands", it's scum. It is said that how much Korean people like to play in the water along the scenic rivers. PS: even if the woman dresses in poor shape, it is obvious that plastic surgery is just the rhythm of going to a small clinic.
