Thirteen years later, the special effects are still not timid, which is commendable. But the reason why the hero doesn't like robots is too much, and the kind of human chauvinism in the second half of the film also makes me very uncomfortable. Robots can not hurt human beings, you robots will definitely hurt us human beings, robots do not hesitate to kill the same kind for human beings, especially the third point, if the robot is replaced by a dog, it should be scolded to death. Why are you humans so great? why don't you go to heaven?
