How much meat does this depilated Tibetan mastiff have to eat to grow so big? The core of the movie is the words of the minister of power. I gave you all the people. Don't eat me. You are just an illusion. I made it up. The throne is an illusion, made up by the king, power is the strength, can make up any illusion. At first glance, this powerful minister only learned Chinese characters but not the essence of Chinese culture. You deserve it.
