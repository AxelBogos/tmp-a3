In my opinion, the praise is basically the audience's self-high and yy, on the contrary, many of the gunfight injuries in the plot are turned a blind eye. The sniper was so condescending that he could not hit a single person, but was forced back by several pistols. Is the sniper's name Li Gui? The shooter pretending to be a cleaner in the mall did not change his face in the face of several fierce men holding pistols. Isn't this an obvious ghost? If a few protagonists really have the IQ given by those who are praised by the five stars, do you have to wait for him to pull out his gun?
