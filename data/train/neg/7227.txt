Is the person who scored five serious? As a hp fan, I fell asleep several times in the cinema with a pregnant belly of nearly nine months, and the plot was bad and the details were bad. Is it worth the fact that I finally persuaded my family to sit in the dark and airtight cinema until I was swollen? I want to give a negative score!
