A star is for Xu Qing. This film gives people an out-and-out sense of money fraud. The handsome image of the killer has been tarnished. The story is bad, full of mistakes, and meaningless. Finally, Joe says a monologue, "mothers will sacrifice themselves to protect their children, men will cry to save their wives *" I thought there was some truth that I didn't realize. Think about it. It's still old-fashioned. Pseudo-science fiction. I watched it after I was sleepy. Nima was bored to death with the loud and rumbling effect.
