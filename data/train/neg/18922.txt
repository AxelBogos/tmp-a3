Like the TV version of SpongeBob, optimistic, kind, lovely and friendly SPONGE BOB. The movie version was turned off halfway through it. The plot is too boring to look good. It doesn't look good. You'd better watch the TV version obediently. Especially the first few episodes of the first season were very good. Interesting and creative.
