I didn't like the movie. I was looking forward to it. The heroine is very confused, and the film process does not grow up. Can burning the past really make you leave the past and become the new yourself? Will it make her more confident if she is lucky enough to meet the first friend she can talk to? In the end, I can't accept myself, can I? This is not youth. One star gives the positive energy that the movie tries to bring to the audience (but doesn't bring much).
