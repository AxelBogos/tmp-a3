What kind of bad movie is Nima? is Zeus stupid in the movie? The human beings in their eyes are the protagonists? And intervened in the world many times. The prophetess in the film saw that the handsome guy was decisively not a nun. This kind of person is not worthy to be a prophet at all.
And this picture, you do a little better, you hate this kind of indoor drama, just like "Sparta 300 Warriors", the CG effect is fake B, the scene is depressed, the color is strange, and the picture is extremely unreal.
