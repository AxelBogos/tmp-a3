I really don't understand why there are so many high reviews. There is nothing special about the pictures and special effects, but there is nothing special about the stories and characters. Many people are repeatedly emphasizing the second story told by Pi. Indeed, we can feel the connection between human nature, survival and other elements, but the small space plus intuitive narration, how can people have profound reflection and aftertaste? although it has something to do with the previous adventure, the fantasy without the picture is meaningless.
