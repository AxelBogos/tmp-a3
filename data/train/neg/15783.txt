It sucks! After watching the Busan trip, I felt that I still wanted to understand a lot of questions, and I was cheated by one of the film critics who was definitely written by the staff! Angry! I thought the film would answer why those animals were infected and which country developed it (really naive). As a result, there was no at all, but the plot was super bad, and the IQ of the protagonist left me speechless. It is not recommended to see it! I have no idea who infected the old man and who bit him at the beginning of the film.
