It's a good movie, but it's not good. In fact, it wants to talk about something similar to Truman's World, but in terms of popularity, I'd rather see the latter 10 times than the former once. I can't help but feel sad at the thought of this. How I miss Jim Carrey's high-spirited, hapless and extremely happy face.
