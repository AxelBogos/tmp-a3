In 1919, two big expectations lacked a disappointing movie-the other was a restarted version of Hellboy. Although this film is not the same as Baronet, it is all disappointing. Hellboy is a make-up set artist who sucks in pettiness and plot. This one is well-made, but the plot is disappointing. Originally, it was aimed at watching the monster fight, but it turned out to be dark everywhere, soot everywhere, and light pollution everywhere, but the monster could not see clearly. Some people speculate that it is a cost consideration. I don't know if it's true or not. But it's really disappointing. There is also the nonsense behavior of the protagonist family accounts for most of the space, how to say.
