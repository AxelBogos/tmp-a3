It took me a lot of energy to download the film. I managed to finish watching the film, which lasted only 101 minutes. I suffered a lot and lived like a year. I knew from the beginning of the film that it was a bad film, and I was sure there would be an extremely far-fetched ending, and I was right. The reason why I didn't delete it shortly after the beginning is that I really don't have the heart to waste so much energy, and the other is to see what a stupid ending this stupid director will give to the film.
