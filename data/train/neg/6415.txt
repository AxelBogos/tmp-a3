I admire the director because in the best years of his life, he watched "those years" this year and filmed "the year of graduation". It means that there is no worst, only worse. The greatest virtue of a man is not to forgive the stupidity of others, but to pursue his dreams in his unlimited stupidity. Recall the young man who was mentally retarded in the year of graduation.
