Brainwashing products, independent thinking test cards, full of self-righteous logic (Nolan's film history shows the advantages and disadvantages of Leo incisively and vividly), plot motivation can not stand IQ scrutiny, the specific plot of the reversal is one of the most hypocritical. I have to say that in the last movie, the clown diverted too much attention and saved Nolan.
