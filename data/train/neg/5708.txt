A very poor director and screenwriter
Is it so hard to tell a story that doesn't hurt people now?
Sketchy bridge section design
SB character and personality setting.
The storyline is not as good as the vernacular of the Qing Dynasty and the Hong Kong-style martial arts of 1919.
Do you really have no idea how ugly your picture is?
