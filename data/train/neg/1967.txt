It feels strange to deliberately make an old and mature movie at the beginning of the film, and the narrator after that is so disgusting that I can't even watch it because of that voice, and I can't have my own thinking and understanding. I thought that the version I saw was wrong. I asked my friend that it was the same in the cinema. I was really speechless, explaining every psychological activity and gesture of the actors there all the time, and treating the audience as a big idiot? I can't even watch it if I want to.
