I thought the wall was rotten to the extreme. I never thought there was more lurking. I think the innovative comedy dialogue is pretty good, but this evil heroine, how can your face, which is more bitter than balsam pear, match our virtuous and beautiful white lady? With all due respect, I really don't see how you fell in love with Xu Xian at all. There are no bedding and details at all. Isn't this a love film? even if you can't make a good film of love, what can you say?
