It was supposed to be a refreshing film focusing on depression, but it turned out to be the use of depression to cover up a plot for deliberate murder. How come there are still people who are not looking for a disease? in the end, it didn't come to a good end. I hate this kind of thing, because too much multimedia publicity links mental illness with terror, so mental illness makes people avoid it.
