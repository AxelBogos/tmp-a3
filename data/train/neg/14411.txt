It is a pity that it was originally a script that had a chance to shoot well, but it was filmed as an embarrassing four dissimilarities. Inexplicably inserted a lot of blunt implant ads and boring jokes. The first half is heavily injected with water, and the second half is reversed and folded, but because the front bedding is too bad, it can not save the overall impression. It's all bad to wear all the makeup. And how boring it is to have so many diamonds on the murder weapon.
