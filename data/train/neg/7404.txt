Junior high school students will cry when they read it, while high school students will be silent. I don't think anyone who has studied the history of the warring States can swallow it. In the trailer, the second disease exploded, and I dared to watch the positive film. I admire myself. Not to mention the high configuration of clothing and etiquette, but this production is really shoddy, the plot is also a childish to the extreme fan idol drama, the acting skills all rely on shouting. The production level is comparable to that of domestic online dramas. I want to see the Qin Empire wash my eyes.
