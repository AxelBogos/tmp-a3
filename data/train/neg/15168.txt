The logic of the first half of the drama is confused, and the second half of the naval battle is also bullshit. the scene is not as good as that of the Caribbean six years ago, which basically belongs to the Smecta version of the unarmed devils. In history, the naval battle of Mingliang is not worth mentioning at all. Now it is entirely national propaganda. At that time, both sea and land were won by the Ming Dynasty. Su Yuan's affection for South Korean films was completely ruined by this film.
