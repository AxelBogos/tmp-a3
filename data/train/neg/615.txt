Although a movie sucks not just because of one person, but I still hope that Lu Han, if you don't like acting, don't force yourself. You don't have to play games every day until the wee hours of the morning. You really disrespect the film industry and make people feel that you love acting. I think you can quit. Really, don't you want to have a second child anyway? Have a good discussion with Xiaotong. Don't come out to harm the audience. Thank you.
