I thought it was said that ghosts were not allowed, why was this "what the heck" released? In fact, I am quite curious (but also out of curiosity to see if it is really bad), why this kind of bad film can persist in shameless shooting up to now. From the plot to the acting skills are fascinated, next door Wu Laoer to be able to hold the camera can be better than him, a bunch of scheming bitches, harm to themselves and finally can not make a success, it is shit.
