At that time, I didn't know who introduced it, saying that this was the last episode of the Night's Watch, and then I watched it tragically backwards. As a result, I didn't understand anything when I was watching this movie. I didn't understand the plot, and I didn't find the feeling of Russia. I remember seeing a Russian teenager looking for relics from World War II. I almost felt bad.
