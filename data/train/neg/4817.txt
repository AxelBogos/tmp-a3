Don't say that others are too extreme to stare at this stupid drama. the problem is that this rumor-mongering drama is really thought carefully, and the hidden meaning of distorting history can not be erased by changing its name. It is OK to see Mary Su's silly and thoughtless entertainment play, but to support this ill-intentioned screenplay is to be mentally retarded.
