It's not my type. The story is plain and scattered, and the picture is also general. In addition to the Japanese-style small and fresh scenery picture, the characters and monsters are too crude and have no characteristics. I really couldn't hold on in the last half hour, so I left early. This film is still 8 points, hehe.
