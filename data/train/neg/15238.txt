To quote the egg: Clint Eastwood might have the biggest boner about America. It is indeed quite legendary, but the non-war scenes are filmed too much! It's hard! Look! A wife and child with more background than background. But the part of Sniper is so cool, confirmed kills is more than 160. in the last shot, I can't even see where the other sniper is. Bradley Cooper's acting is so bad.
