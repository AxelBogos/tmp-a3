This series really likes to kill the characters that the audience likes, first killing Spock, then killing Kirk twice, and now killing Data. According to this trend, it should be the next big bald head. The clone with a big bald head is ugly in all kinds and looks rich and handsome. At heart, he is a rebellious young man, and the plot is weak. Data is very successful and is more human than human. He doesn't understand why Mao wants to kill such a full character.
