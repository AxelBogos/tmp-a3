A film full of rainbow flags. CP against me. I always feel like the preacher has a look on his face. â˜œ picture quality is simply GV picture quality, it feels like some pictures are shot with DV, and then my subtitles are not very good. Anyway, I endure watching them and feel that missionary brother is really poor.
