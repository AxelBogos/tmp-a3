Guo Jingfei in this piece is like Shen Teng in a shy iron fist, funny when there is a stalk, and funny when there is no stalk, anyway, there is a sense of joy as soon as it appears. Some small segments of the movie are all right, and the special effects are just so-so, that is, when can we give up the setting of the waste man, ah, whether the force value is enough and the IQ can be raised?
