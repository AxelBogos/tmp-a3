The third-rate script of the disc market, the clip jumps, the empty composition, the story fragments are fragmented, and the actors stray. Aerial mirrors and aerial shots have repeatedly misled people into thinking that they are promotional films for tourism in Hong Kong and Macao, and the film feels like digital television. Borrowlism is obvious: the reappearance of the detective scene, the repeated street battles of the spy movies, the carriages of the raid 2, the office of the head explosion and the unpacking of the seven deadly sins (the action play is also poorly choreographed). Although the character deliberately denies it, the name of Kowloon, the emptiness and reality of the dragon, combined with the traditional symbol of the oriental dragon, all reveal the remembrance and recovery of the old Hong Kong-the dragon is the old feeling, the old prosperity, the color in black and white memories, and the call dragon is intended to capture the old atmosphere. The old-fashioned narrator and subtitles in the film also turn the painting style into an old Hong Kong late-night life drama, as if filming "Detective" in the style of "under the Lion Rock". I don't know what mentality director Chen Guo used to choreograph and direct the film. It looks more like a ticket for a police and bandit movie, with contraband goods of his iconic issues. Finally, complain that you can't lose that belly in half a month!
