"across the Seas" is probably the most romantic of John Woo's shootout films. In addition to the wonderful shootout and confrontation scenes, the description of the relationship between men and women is also exquisite. The mature star charm of Chow Yun-fat, Zhong Chuhong and Zhang Guorong is unforgettable in the film.
