The bad script determines the bad start of everything. Deng Chao's performance still has a problem of exerting too much effort, which probably has something to do with his sitcom background. The only highlight of this film is Deng Chao listening to and singing "Love Business" in the kitchen and pretending to be blind about Smecta. The overall situation is so bad that it can only be given one star.
