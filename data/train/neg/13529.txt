Maybe the director wants to express the helplessness, boredom, repetition, boredom and reincarnation of real life, which may be related to the director's life and world outlook at that time, but it doesn't need to be expressed in movies, is it? If life is like this, there is no need for me to spend money on movies to be so dull.
