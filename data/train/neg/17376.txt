The first half is quite OK, holding it, laughing all the way after the fight, wiggling around, rolling into the city, is there King Bahobali, the plot is reversed, your sister is so shallow that you can guess every step, I have been wondering whether you dare to be creative, but you haven't. And pay tribute to Akira Kurosawa? What's the resemblance? Watch the Shadow Warrior again later. He he.
