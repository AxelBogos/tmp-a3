There is no SM in the poster. The Germans sexually assaulted the bearded man, are they vilifying comrades? The heroine helped the old man inexplicably. The plot can't stand up to scrutiny, all kinds of unpredictable human evil, interpersonal games. Edward's young short-haired men were so handsome that they could not bear to shoot only rubber bullets for the heroine.
