"A Chinese Odyssey 3"-I can understand a lot of bad movies, but I can't forgive the consumption of Zhou Xingchi's bad movies. Even fast-forward watching the whole film is a waste of time, the only function is to put an end to a dispute: many people argue whether Zhou Xingchi accomplished A Chinese Odyssey or Liu Zhenwei accomplished A Chinese Odyssey. Once this film is released, there is no need to argue. Oh, one.
