I just found out that it was Lei Lei's self-directed (remake) self-directed and self-starring Lei Lei. Wang Xun and Li Liqun seem to have acted in any good films since their good fortune. Wang Xun and Li Liqun have made a splendid film because they have seen too many pictures. Her every appearance is a bad match for Snowflake.
