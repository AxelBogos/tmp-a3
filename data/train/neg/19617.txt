I came to watch in admiration. As for me, I can't understand it, but I attribute it to a divine translation. Most of the key places do not have subtitles and do not dare to watch film reviews, feeling that they will only spoil the original understanding of the picture. In contrast, I think that "adapted script" better absorbs the advantages of the film, and film technology can also help to achieve strong personality expression and stylized narrative.
