Although I understand that this is a cool little fresh love story wrapped in your coat, but the hero is really annoying! The kind of hypoxic expression of "I am very simple, I love you very much, although I don't know how to express it, but I really love you" is really good! Annoying! Aah! Silly Bai Tian is a nuisance to both men and women!
