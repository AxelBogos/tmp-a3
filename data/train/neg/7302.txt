The movie was uncomfortable, the lines were embarrassed, and the story was as stiff as a recitation contest for primary school students (if I really want to see a deep animation, it would be better for bilibili to finish watching "seahorse" at home). After watching the movie, I found that the motorcycle was also towed away by the chengguan. I went home at night and kicked iron piles in the community. Last Sunday was the unluckiest day for me in the past few years.
