Fortunately, I didn't go to the cinema. At the beginning of the scene, the heroine was very disgusting, completely unable to understand this kind of daughter who was kidnapped in resources and videotaped in front of the kidnappers regardless of the life or death of others. Four years of news is full of shit, right? I even took pictures when I rushed down the snow mountain. Why not let this son of a bitch fall and die? There are too many places to complain, there is nothing new to fight, the special effects are very fake, bad movies.
