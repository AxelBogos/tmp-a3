I saw the film only after reading the original work. The adaptation sucks. All kinds of settings are completely different from the original, and the relationship between all kinds of murder weapons and characters is not reflected at all. The development of the plot has also been adapted completely different from the original. A completely bad movie. Empty, no content. All kinds of disappointments.
