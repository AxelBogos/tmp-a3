The author must have seen a lot of American TV dramas such as "CSI", "Criminal Psychology", "Supernatural Detective" and all kinds of collages of deja vu. But the so-called profiling is just a boring show of skill, and the chain of evidence is not convincing. The detective becomes self-speaking, and in the end, the audience becomes "all right, whatever you say, I'm too lazy to argue with you." Do not feel suspense, do not feel scary, but also wasted Liao Fan's acting skills.
