After revising the previous evaluation, it was also a high-production stupid film with a gorgeous lineup of redjuice+EGOIST+WIT (former Production I.G6 class), and even brought in Hanoi, which is not even as good as evil network management from a narrative point of view. Perhaps the only advantage is that there are lovely boys who can prpr and Royal Sister cilantro, which is a hundred times cuter than Pink Bichi.
