Compared with "unrequited love", at least the story foundation is good. But there is something wrong with the narrative technique, and the heroine is indeed superfluous. At present, such a simple story of Xiaoqiang can no longer satisfy me. The special effects are estimated to be not cheap, which is simply too wasteful.
