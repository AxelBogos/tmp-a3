Maybe the personal understanding ability is really not deep, the plot is procrastinating, east and west, I really can not string together, vaguely feel that it is a discussion of human nature, the hero is selfish and biased, suddenly there is a period of people and animals in the middle, a little do not know why, it is very depressing from beginning to end!
