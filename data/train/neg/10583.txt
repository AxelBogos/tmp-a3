Another disappointing stereotyped Olympic bid film, retro atmosphere to create a very hard, lively U. S. Immigration Service promotional film, the plot is simple without any twists and turns, but the latter part is extremely unconvincing. The relationship between the heroine and Gao Fu Shuai is simply too inexplicable, and the motivation to promote the heroine to return to the United States is even more far-fetched. As a matter of fact, I do not know how superficial it is to express the aspirations of that generation of immigrants.
