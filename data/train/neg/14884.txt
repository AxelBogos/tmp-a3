The absolute author film not only separates the director from the fans, but also separates the principle of art film. The long shot is too long, the lines are too boring, the actors are too grandiose, and the scene is too pretentious. I guess the director himself can't say what his fragmented little idea is trying to say! There are no principles for art movies to speak of. This kind of films completely put aside the story attribute and give you a lecture on philosophy and so on.
