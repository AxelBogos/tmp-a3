I don't know exactly what the plot is like in the original cartoon, but this animation is really bad. Admittedly, its age is relatively early, and it is understandable that it cannot compare with today's animation due to technical reasons, but the screenwriter and the split lens are not. We can see that many important scenes in the film are skipped directly, without sincerity, probably in order to save money, and the screenwriter really can not find the focus when dealing with the plot. To take a simple example, the Huang Mao Bichi was made into a specimen. Did the screenwriter explain why? She is a doctor in the ground town second only to Eddard, who can help the factory director maintain his fight field and give the factory director grass, the most important thing is that the false promise to her is far from the day that must be fulfilled, and it is necessary to find a homeless person to make a specimen. Is it necessary to use such a useful object? It would be reasonable to explain that he was trying to prevent the leakage of the female master's plan, but not in the play, but nothing was said in order to increase the dramatic effect of the scene in which the doctor saw the specimen. It is really cheap and inferior to portray the evil image of the villain who is divorced from practical significance and interests.
