Friends want to see a movie, the time is more awkward, there is really nothing to see, so I chose this one. This movie... It's really... How to say, every time this dog is reincarnated, he can meet his ex-master within that range. The world is so big that every time he is reincarnated in the same country, not far away, he can meet his ex-master among all living beings. It's really amazing. What else can I say?
