Disappointment is acceptable to shameless bastards, but this time it's a little out of touch. This film is full of what I used to play with, and the narrative rhythm of soundtrack editing also makes people feel insincerity, which can be said to be a mess. Three stars is not enough to express my desire and dissatisfaction.
