The film has a lot of problems in some key plots and rhythms, and the cause of the story is too deliberate and stupid, and the later twists and turns are incomparably stiff. The director may be in pursuit of the old-school realistic action movie style to make the film look boring most of the time, Run all night's sense of urgency is not well reflected, really lack of excitement and the best part of the paragraph. 5/10
