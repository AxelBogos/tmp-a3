Huh? 8.3mm? The old aunt on Douban-like me, is really crazy. Love you Simon did not see "the first mainstream gay film produced and distributed by a mainstream Hollywood filmmaker and released simultaneously in 2402 theaters across the United States and rated as PG13." I shut up, loved the marketing btw.
