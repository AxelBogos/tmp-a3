Twelve angry men is a classic of famous film history, and this is only a shoddy copy, not serious, only absurd. It is absurd to ask parents to take a make-up exam if students fail. It is absurd to join the security guard and the commissary boss to make up the numbers. What is supposed to be a serious film is based on such absurdity that it can only turn into a complete farce.
Especially after Zhou Qiang, the head of the Supreme Court of China, said that he should resolutely resist the influence of western erroneous ideological trends such as "constitutional democracy", "separation of powers" and "judicial independence", dare to shine his sword, and resolutely fight against the erroneous words and deeds of denying Communist Party of China's leadership and slandering the socialist rule of law and judicial system with Chinese characteristics, and must not fall into the "trap" of western erroneous ideas and judicial independence. It all the more seems that the movie is a joke. Finally, the identity of the prosecutor is the joke in the joke, it is simply the touch of Liu Bieqian, and even a little dystopian, Big Brother is looking at you.
