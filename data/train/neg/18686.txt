6.5 points. If you want to cover everything, you often end up missing it. When we talk about grand historical events, we must start from the human heart. The director focused on the hotel and certainly wanted to see the whole through a small part, but the excavation of the guests, even the military and police, was very inadequate, and the audience seemed to be hindered by something no matter how positive they were. Because of the lack of these excavations and shapes, these characters cannot enter the hearts of the audience and cannot stir up their joys and sorrows.
