I haven't felt the story of Jane Eyre since I read the book, and the later changes in film and television works can't change this situation, nor can this new version of Gothic Xiaoqing. Maybe it's because I don't like the bitter and bitter background of the story, or what kind of Witty Dialogue and Ironic Tone suits me.
