It's not that I discriminate against female directors, at least the film is a little watery and feels like it's missing the point at all. I understand that the director wants to play with realism, but the pace is too slow, lack of the best parts and changes, the tension and cruelty of war are basically not filmed, and several characters are powerless. Inexplicable persistence, inexplicable sacrifice. I almost fell asleep several times during the period of watching. I don't understand why I was nominated for the Golden Globes.
