Wu Zhenyu imitating the traitor Jian is really too affected and embarrassing (this embarrassing performance is almost as good as the demon bell)! Liu Qingyun is all right, imitating Xu Guanwen quite well, and not completely imitating but also bringing his own performance style. Gu Tianle imitates Xu Guanjie & Bruce Lee. Chen Xiaochun's imitation of Xu Guanying is also bad, but it is not as embarrassing as Wu Zhenyu. Cecilia Cheung's performance is actually quite natural in it.
