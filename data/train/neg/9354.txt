It was worse than Thailand, and there was almost no laughing point. I felt like I finished watching the whole audience as if in silence. The plot is also sloppy, mechanically cobbled together. I didn't realize that the pink head was yellow until I rolled the subtitles. And the three times Zhang Ziyi came out is not as important as Fan Bingbing in Thailand. Ziyi, you must beat Bingbing. I have always been optimistic about you!
