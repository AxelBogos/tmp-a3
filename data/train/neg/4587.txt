Specially used Alipay points for Youku VIP, honestly, did not fast-forward to see the whole film, so, finally can face without shame to give their own evaluation. The legendary 11 lines are so brain-burning that no matter how many times you try to straighten out the story, you will find there is nothing you can do about it. The overall production is showing a disaster-level collapse, the quality has almost been so bad as the eighteenth-rate idol drama, it is polite to say that it is useless. I have no intention to speculate on what Director Bi really thinks, but in the midst of all the cynicism, I do not believe that he completely fails to understand the meaning of these criticisms.
