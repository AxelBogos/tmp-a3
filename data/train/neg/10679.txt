After watching it at 1.5 times the speed, I feel very sorry that I didn't drive twice as fast. I can only say that I am not the audience of this kind of TV series. The story will be the self-YY of a frustrated man in love at 8: 00. The life-and-death masochism between the mistress and the catcher? Both male and female suicides, EXO-M? Go to the theater and kill yourself? What brain circuit? How can a beautiful and rich woman in her twenties fall in love with a gold-free, greasy middle-aged man? If it wasn't for Xiaolan's young and beautiful curator, how could curator Sun like it? You also question that the mistress is the other woman, and you have ulterior motives, all right? do you see which young and beautiful girl doesn't have weak legs? The heroine Duan Xiaolan's appearance is quite in line with my aesthetic wishes that she will embark on a better path, or she may have been hurt by love. I can't understand other people's love. Good-bye.
