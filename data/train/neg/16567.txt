55ft 100, I really didn't expect Hosoda to do animation for so many years and then come back to the same old thing? The story is very personal, but how boring it is to implement it. I don't like children in the first place, not to mention taking this 4-year-old boy as the protagonist. The theme is the fetters of a family and the growth of characters, but how can there be emotion? All I see is pale and broken.
