Reminds me of "the best of times". Shu Qi is probably too eager to get rid of the idea of "becoming famous as soon as he takes off" that she has always positioned her role in this type of character with no desire to become strong. But she really didn't have the material to play this role, and she wasted her otherwise sexy face. Forgive me for watching this movie because I am a fan of Zhang Zhen, otherwise I would have missed an one-star evaluation.
