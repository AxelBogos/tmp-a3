I'm sorry, because I watched the animation first, so it's hard to accept the live version. The biggest failure is the failure of the casting, dengu is too unsuitable for this role, and Tamiya Ryoko, mother, hostess, none of them are successful, not to mention acting skills are you in such a hurry to eat shit?
