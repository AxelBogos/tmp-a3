In the experience of watching movies on pins and needles, giving a low score does not mean that the film is not good, but it is wrong to make it annoying. Russ is always sophisticated in storytelling techniques and skills, double-edged sword lies in so strongly shaping such an image, from the far-reaching degree of its influence and effect, it is absolutely not worth publicizing, such a specific dark, it is completely offensive, disgusting, and the use of the first person, it is difficult to argue that it is not a positive foil, from this point of view, the director's behavior is even anti-human. I hope he just intends to create a topic by shooting it to the extreme. The film itself should be banned.
