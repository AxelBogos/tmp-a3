This illustrates, when is the most beautiful time? After the college entrance examination? I do not know what to express, whether the hero is scum or not, making a movie is also hypocritical, the character of the protagonist can not be defined. If you are recounting the life of a college couple in a room, what is the point? Or in the narrative of the love story that has been going on since college, so why did you just shoot a meal at the end? After reading it, there was no emotion or gain.
