Success is like a TV movie, the ups and downs and the means of expression are very old-fashioned. Li Chen's personal aesthetic and artistic pursuit are not flattering. The story is like a plate of loose sand. The script is only to split into hostile camps and let the plane face off. This is the ultimate goal of the film to show off, but the budget is limited, the director is lack of skills, and the sense of substitution and enthusiasm are even worse than Wolf Warriors 2. Just enjoy your husband and wife life after 200 million black bull at the box office, and don't get involved in it.
