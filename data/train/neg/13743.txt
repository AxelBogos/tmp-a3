The auction of Kong net made me very uncertain, so I watched it on and off, and I couldn't bear the director of Milk Qiang. If "Dragon and Tiger Gate" is a "literary drama zero score", how much should the literary drama of this film be rated? Martial arts is just a Remix version of "fuse" and "Ip Man".
