In the whole process, there is no way to avoid lightning: this mother and daughter want their father to die and beg him not to die again. Why are there so many plays?! Those monsters are even more powerful, such as going to heaven, going to sea, spraying electricity, transitioning, getting bigger, soaking lava, building storms, anti-missiles, physical regeneration, proficiency in foreign languages, and being omnipotent, making science fiction films into magic films alive. Monsters from extraterrestrials are really cool. I really want to ask who hibernated them at first.
