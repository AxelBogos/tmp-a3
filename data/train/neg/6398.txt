The plot is too thunderous, the concept of love is too deformed, the acting skill is too poor, pretending to be full of breath. God knows why I want to watch this movie! Only watch the first half of the movie can still get two stars, is from the later stage began to completely collapse. In fact, if you shoot this story well, you can get a good score (maybe I'll give you a 4-star). At most, people will complain about the plot, but it will look good, but shooting like this makes me speechless.
