Foolishly explode the sky. How stupid a screenwriter can make up a plot? As a boss, you let an idiot do things for you, just do it, don't give him things that are important to the company.
The idiot freaked out when he was scared by the police. you have to stabilize him. If you touch your employee, you leave him a lousy job, and he gets scared and asks the police to pick on you. Boss Jia, do you want to have a drink u away when you enter the nightclub? Or suit&tie?
