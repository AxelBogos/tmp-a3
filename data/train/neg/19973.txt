Two stars, I have played games, although I understand that due to the problem of time and space, I can't expect too much. The main strange things are: (1) the true night is not cute at all; (2) the funny scenes specially created when the reasoning is wrong are not funny at all; (3) the claustrophobia of Yu Jian is gone (but there is also a reasonable part of this change). Although there are some bright spots. In short, it can only be said that, as an original lover, I have all kinds of feelings.
