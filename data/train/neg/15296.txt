Out of my love for Bishop, I won't play a star anymore. For example, One Art is obviously written to Alice Methfessel, although through the previous 14 drafts (it seems to be this number) and the final draft, it is not difficult to see Bishop's substitution of Lota's physical characteristics and his personal experience in Brazil, but in the end, this poem is intended to retain Methfessel and succeed. The writer's understanding of Bishop may only stay on wikipedia, and he may not even read all of wiki.
