Am I watching the extended version of the TV series? Isn't the rhythm too strange? It has nothing to do with it! Liu Shishi unexpectedly doesn't like Zhang Zhen but likes that Childe Yan who can only stare. Can't you please find someone handsome to act? Liu Shishi's crying scene is really not beautiful. Add one more star to Zhang Zhen.
