Two people who won't die if they don't die show the audience how boring a movie can be. What is the pursuit of a failed driver who has no money and insists on having a second child and going to Hong Kong to give birth? What kind of IQ is this when a lady and her husband run away and refuse to face the reality and sit back and eat nothing? This play made me understand that acting can not save the stupid and boring plot, it will only make the audience want to complain more.
