I guess this kind of film full of violence and blood must be marked with 18 bans, but the writer tries to show the lower limit to us adults with an IQ of less than five. The heroine relies on the halo of the protagonist, with a "good heart" to do bad things, naive and kind but no brain, really deserve to die ten thousand times. And that stupid environmentalist, all stupid idiots with zero IQ, the movie made me angry, one star.
