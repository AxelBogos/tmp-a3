The script is the same as a child's play. Yang Jiadong, what did you check as a policeman? Is the right-handed A better than you? Where is the suspense? Where is the sense of the times? Dog blood strange love Parkinson, is not a mystery for a long time is not a "floating city riddle 2"? I'm sorry, I really can't see the screenwriter's technique, nor can I feel the charm of narrative, let alone Lou Ye's film aesthetics. After the screenwriter sets up the framework of a genre, there is no real plot, large chunks of state drama and unprovoked emotional and character behavior, and this sense of fragmentation and fragmentation is definitely not caused by censorship. I really think that Lou Ye and Mei Feng should read Henggou's official history of "the hanging Home on the Hospital Slope" to see how others construct an ethical tragedy that spans decades in the context of the times. PS: is Lou Ye a master? Master my ass!
