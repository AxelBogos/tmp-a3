If you don't go to see a movie for the first time, give it to this "love apartment". Nothing else, plagiarism is rubbish, continue to cheat with it after plagiarism, has lost the bottom line of life.
The higher the box office of this kind of film, the more it shows the ignorance and sadness of the Chinese people.
