The hostess who despises the small place in her hometown works and lives by writing novels for others in the city. On days without work, she sleeps until noon and sleeps in a messy bedroom, opens her eyes and sees strangers sleeping next to her, opens the refrigerator, and eats leftovers. In a very sarcastic movie, a brief glory will not last a lifetime, and a chaotic life will never have a way out.
