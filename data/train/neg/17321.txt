The film has the taste of early Hong Kong gangster films, and we can feel that Wang Jing intends to imitate Johnnie to, but it is a pity that there are not many new ideas, and the shooting technique is also very different from that of du Lao. The story is too old-fashioned, and the ending has already guessed that if you can only compare the movie with Wang Jing herself, I like Chen Xiaochun, who is the best actor, and can remember the role he played. In recent years, Hong Kong films have to be said to show a retrogressive trend. There has been no amazing Hong Kong film since Infernal Affairs. Once the glamorous 1980s was gone, the rivers and lakes are still the same, but the people and mentality have changed.
