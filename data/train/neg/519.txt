be rather baffling! What the fuck is this? The story of a deck of playing cards? The story of the film is naive and superficial, and the acting skills of the protagonist are awkward. The director wants to show all the photographic special effects he can think of in one film, regardless of whether it has anything to do with the plot of the film. How can the protagonist still live a life worse than a pig and dog in reality? This screenwriter may have shit in his head, and such a stingy story can be made up with a lick of his face. Watching this movie is an insult to intelligence. Even a stupid movie like this doesn't bother to type and comment.
