From the present point of view, there are almost only achievements in the art of film; other aspects, such as philosophy, human nature and science fiction, are not worth mentioning compared with today's movies! I admit I don't understand; after reading the comments, I understand that I don't need to understand at all! How much is there to understand in this film? After reading it, I found that I had seen it before, but today I had no impression at all! Due to the limitations of the 20th century, this film is not available at all and is a waste of time!
