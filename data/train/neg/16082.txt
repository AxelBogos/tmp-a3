The film with the biggest gap between the reviews I have seen so far and the film itself. P.S. I didn't leave the scene, I didn't enjoy the empty scene, and I wasn't confused about the plot. That is, I really feel that the idea is very good and the lines are very poor. The pursuit of insipid to the degree of deliberate or deliberate, there is a kind of looking for such an unlovable child you have the kind of do not use the word "cute" in the line ah. It's not bad, it's not good.
