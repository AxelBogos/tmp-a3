(extreme remarks based on my knowledge) Japan in Erzhong has nothing to sympathize with. There are many countries that have suffered from aggression. Every host country has been harmed, but Japan is committed to the ranks of invading countries and is trying to stir up war. There is nothing to blame for the feedback after the invasion. I may be cold-blooded when I say this, but I deserve it.
