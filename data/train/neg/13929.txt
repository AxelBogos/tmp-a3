Inspired by the novel that was upgraded from the original, but only saw stubbornness. Except for the structural adjustment of the problem-solving, all the other items on the adaptation are zero. Cheap mood pot of tea, playing with big radio waves, small trembling mindless unhappy paper people, chatting for two hours full of water. Let Wuben, who is good at frolicking and taking some aggression, play the romance of the whole soft party. A tool that makes the expression of a painting that has been wrongly enhanced with confidence increasingly devoid of flesh and blood. Who should be so aloof?
