Movies are used for appreciation, not for hypnosis. I can't enjoy Yang Dechang's "one by one" either. This one is even more tedious, slow storytelling and too procrastinating, so it would be better to change it to a six-episode TV series. This film makes the deceased (female master) so angry that maybe the prototype of the story is just another boy.
