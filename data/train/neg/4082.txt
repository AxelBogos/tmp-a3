The picture is rough, the acting skill is average, and the expressive force depends on the soundtrack and surprise. The director has no narrative ability, and the length of time is not a reason for making mysteries. He mechanically applies the rotten theme, coupled with the brainless touting of various marketing numbers, and forcibly compensates for adultery with the passers-by audience. The huge gap makes me want to get a negative score.
