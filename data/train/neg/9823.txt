To tell you the truth, the original cartoon and animation are very good, the quality is super high, the style of cartoon painting is fresh, and animation has become a classic. Only this movie, I'm sorry, I tried very hard to see it two or three times, changed NTU, the setting is too far, there is no charm and bright spot, except for Sora, there is no acceptable place. Moreover, Hanamoto and Sora are not the same route, not the right taste.
