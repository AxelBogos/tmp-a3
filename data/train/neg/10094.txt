Like the glittering girl, my teenage days, this kind of freshness is terrible in Douban. As a matter of fact, the plot is quite good at the beginning. Xu Lu's interpretation of Bao Whale's lines is not bad, but I have wanted to turn off the TV since the appearance of the second dimension. I have seen the burst drummer and then watched the swinging girl look like a small fuss. After watching the rocking girl and then watching the shining girl, I think wtf. The most important thing, no matter how bad the adult limelight has overshadowed the protagonist Chen Jing, what does the director think?
