It's a typical Ye's love movie, but it's not worse than the previous one. My mind is not as sloppy as it used to be. Maybe it's because Ye Nianchen is not the director? Or that he has grown up and is no longer the age to watch the "my favorite" love trilogy. Originally wanted to give two stars, but there is one star firmly buckled in Liu Xinyou..
