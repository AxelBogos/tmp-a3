You have a pair of hands but idle and willing to fall, you deserve to be spurned by the world, you do not deserve sympathy and respect, not the world indifference, life is your own choice. I don't know what the film is trying to tell people, but there are so many poor things that it really doesn't count. I would also like to say that the little girl is bothering me. If you want to say that her acting skills are amazing, I have seen her interview and still hate her.
