One and a half stars, extremely disappointed. Western-style special effects monsters are at odds with the group calisthenics of Zhang Yimou's large-scale spiritual civilization construction, as if preparing for war while performing on stage, more like a freak who failed to combine China with the West. The setting of the five armed forces is a complete decoration, and I don't know what it means. The so-called Hollywood classic script model is actually rotten stalks and routines. The story is boring and the rhythm is not good. Don't throw away the actors and actresses. Whoever acts is a bad movie.
