Dramatic performance, the so-called dark is the tone of black and gray, the so-called moment is really only talked about this month, watched for two hours to find that the best part is the ending sentence, it turned out that this is a speech program, forgive me, I was not touched at all. How on earth is such a crisis solved? we can't just rely on temporary speeches, can we? There are no follow-up details. With such a good costume and background, I would rather see Churchill for the rest of his life.
