Fortunately, when I went to see "the Legend of the Magic string" and "the Space Traveller" on the first day of release, I didn't buy a ticket to see "David Bacon's hapless Agent Bear", otherwise he might be on pins and needles and roll his eyes to fatigue in the cinema. If I think it's a waste of money or something, I'm out of luck: the level of 3D animation technology is low, and the story is bad. The character shape is still so ugly, it is better to leave the "unlucky bear" to South Korea and not to spoil it.
