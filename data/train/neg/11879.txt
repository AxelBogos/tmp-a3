The story of the scum man and the brainless girl is not unusual, but in the end, the reversal of Takashi Abe is a little unexpected, but compared with Keigo Higano's suspect, he has less reasonable behavior motivation, so it is difficult to move you completely. How could such a Cass lineup make such a movie? Probably just like me, just want to see a bad movie.
