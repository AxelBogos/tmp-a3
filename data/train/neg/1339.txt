I don't like to complain, but Zhenima was disgusted by Wu Jing that the whole movie is your heroic dream, ignoring physical logic. I was embarrassed to fight an army without saying that I was about to get down on my knees and lick a bunch of parties. The scariest part of the movie theater is such a deliberately pretentious plot [Smile] [Smile]
