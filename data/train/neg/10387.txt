I wonder why Happy Mahua can support half of the mainland comedy film market in just a few years, while Deyun Society and Zhao Jiaban in Northeast China, which should have more strength and potential, have not entered the situation at all. First of all, it should be a question of attitude. Teacher Guo Degang personally admitted that making films was purely a game of tickets, and crosstalk actors should keep their acres of land. This sounds like self-knowledge, but in fact, this may not be the case. Because there are no tigers and monkeys in the mountains can be called overlords, ah, teacher Guo drew a frame for himself, self-examination is also a constraint. Zhao Jiaban's situation is more complicated, they have a lot of experience in making TV dramas, rural love is 8 years old. In terms of movies, Dapeng is early, and then there is Xiao Shenyang, but in the end, it is weak, and it does not fully represent Zhao Jiaban, and the current state and interest of their people are probably powerless, the so-called leaderless. As for Happy Ma Hua, individuals insist that they were only given a piece of the pie in the first place, mainly driven by profit, but they didn't know that the small test was so big that it didn't make any sense, and it was only then that there was an uproar.
