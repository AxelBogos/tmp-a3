Three stories, XX (forgotten), lakeside, goodbye. I was a little dizzy at first, but later I found it was a relatively independent segment. The last part of the kiss between Chen Bolin and Jiang Wenli can't bear to look straight in the eye! The title of the film is too hypocritical, and the content is a little bit. Not even here? What do you mean?
