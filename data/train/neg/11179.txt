Children's film, assembly line production, more young teeth than the first story, and the scene shrinks, watching points drop, Jack Blake cameo and bury a foreshadowing at the end, the first half of the puppet appearance atmosphere is more excellent, the second half of the demon dance began to be boring and chaotic, but the whole is still a standard holiday scene film, bluffing children, as a fantasy thriller, no bloodshed scene Fierce fighting is like going through every house, and the demons are all the appearance of a paper tiger. In fact, it is a ferocious type of family reunion in its bones. From an adult point of view, it is still too scratchy, not enjoyable, and unsentimental. ★★
