Lin Jiaxin is invincible. Is this film really a comedy? It's not funny at all. Deng Chao's two jokes (marriage is a grave, swearing) are too old-fashioned. One person inside spoke with one accent, which made him sick to death. Is it true that Lin Jiaxin's "basically I eat trees (vegetarian)" orz and Yi were shot by the same person? Huang Xiaoming is very good at being handsome. It was a thunderous ending. Only Lin Shen is a bright spot.
