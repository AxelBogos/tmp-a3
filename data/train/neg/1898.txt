This area must be blackened in one star. There are almost all the characteristics of bad movies. For example, when you run for your life, you suddenly stop to express your feelings for a while and then run. For example, when the plot is tense, I suddenly stop to recall my childhood. For example, in the face of a big enemy, the protagonist quarreled over uneven mating. For example, when a bad woman sees a witch, she takes the Holy Grail to kill her teammates. For example, the City of skeletons is a flash in the pan and the Holy Grail has not been used. For example, the bad guys can never be killed, and the reinforcements of the good ones are always destroyed.
