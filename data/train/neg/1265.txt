With such a high score of 8.2, I felt so strange. I fell asleep in the first 5 minutes. When I woke up, I found that when I went, I could all pick it up. Then it is reversed over and over again for the sake of reversal, holding the syringe to prick either this or that. So Brother Tang, you don't have a tower to climb, just jump into a tall building and fool it? Exciting and nervous? It doesn't exist. Big scene? The view is all right. Brain-burning plot? Oh, forget it. Compared to four? Are you kidding me? If you can get high marks as long as it's an American blockbuster, well, I'd better watch domestic.
