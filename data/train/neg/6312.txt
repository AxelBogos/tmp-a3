Garbage film, a visible person was unexpectedly given to QJ by a group of blind people, the theme is very good, but the plot is obviously unreasonable. You can say that this woman is kind, but can people stick to their nature in such a desperate situation? Besides, the enemy is still so abominable and ferocious. If this stupid plot is just to pave the way for the abomination of human nature in the aftermath of desperation, why assume that there is a person who is not blind in the first place?
