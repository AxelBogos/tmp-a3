Don't talk about first love, secret love and so on. So black, so short, a girl suddenly turned white in a year, elongated, had plastic surgery, straightened her hair, and then everyone loved it. Wow. I almost coughed up a bucket of dog blood. Ugly people can not be secretly in love with it, must play printed Barbie.
