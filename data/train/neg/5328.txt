Wu Renbao is another miracle. The film has not appeared in the top 15 at the box office since it was released on Oct. 12. In the 44th week, however, Wu Renbao ranked 13th with a weekly box office of $1.64 million, with a cumulative box office of $2.1 million. In other words, in the 10 days from October 12 to October 21, Wu Renbao grossed 460000 at the box office. However, by the third week of its release, the box office showed a reverse growth of 1.64 million, which was the top 10.
