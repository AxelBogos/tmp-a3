Is it necessary to remake? The comic book party said that the Chinese-speaking GET lines were completely less than G-point, and I was lazy to say that the Japanese version was not good enough to read the original comics, but the director was very smart, but he was just clever. I thought he would shoot some new tricks, but in fact, he was just localized. in his senses, he only imitated the boring works of the past and said to those who watched the movie for the first time that the subject was bold and ridiculous.
