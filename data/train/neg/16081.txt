I've been waiting for a long time, but this movie is really disappointing, in addition to the series between the ending and the first film, which also made a good gymnast die, it also shocked me. Every time I saw my foot stepping on a nail, and so on, I felt all kinds of pain, and then all the characters were so damn good. The most 2b hero has at least half an hour's urine in tm.
