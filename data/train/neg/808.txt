A handful of clumsy audio-visual flavors, numb, embarrassed, and a pseudo-high class that collapsed. No presentation, no artistic logic of the film, false "ignition" of the whole process of high fever, collapse of value, confusion of the three values. Regardless of acting, the film itself was unable to complain. In the last ten minutes, Deng Chao's long statement and Ruan Jingtian's sentence, "he is the real light of the city."... Just stand up. Bye.
