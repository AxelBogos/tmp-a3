I like the picture texture of the movie, and this color saturation can help actors externalize their emotions. The worst part is that the script is too bad. Logic doesn't make sense, values are confused and abrupt, and the transition is probably the most blunt transition I've ever seen this year, lacking the groundwork. The lines are also poor, and a whole passage of their lines in the abandoned mansion is magical. The gambler asked the dusty girl what is your dream? It's so embarrassing...
