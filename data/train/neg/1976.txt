If I haven't seen it, it's hard to tell the whole story clearly. It's not interesting. The box office is estimated at 3.5. Americans also work very hard for the Chinese market, not only adding a lot of Chinese elements, but also killing the president. Angela forced her to represent the Chinese beauty with that long hair that shook her head. Perfect as a bystander.
