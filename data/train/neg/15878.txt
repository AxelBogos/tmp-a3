The advantage is that it continues the style of this series, not to steal for money, but to encourage girls who dream of becoming big thieves ~ the characteristics of the actors are also taken care of, the neuroticism of Burton's wife. Hathaway's silly eldest sister or something (or maybe their road is so narrow); the plot also arranges two reversals and revenge, which doesn't look boring. The disadvantage is also obvious, the whole crime process is very lame, who fished out the fake necklace in the pool is not investigated? Why are the ornaments stolen by hand so miraculously undiscovered afterwards? Bullock and Blanchett's faces were ossified and the whole audience depended on clothes.
