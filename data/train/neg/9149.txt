In recent years, the performance of Korean characters is too facial, the people at the bottom are always kind, the bosses of small and medium-sized enterprises are always kind, while the images of bureaucrats and large corporate consortia families are ugly and dirty. live horror, veterans, insiders, kings and so on, all of them are like this, can you really make such a simple distinction? Every film should also set up a grassroots hero who fights desperately for the people at the bottom, which is too deliberate and sensational. At the end of the film, the United States will be blackened by the way, as if IMF has given assistance, but has not been appreciated by the parties.
