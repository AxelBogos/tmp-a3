Beauty clothing Road is very excellent, the whole is indeed the temperament of the late Ming Dynasty. But the screenwriter and performance are really too thunderous, the plot is as broken as ppt, the rhythm is like a documentary, and the film is full of black Jiangnan scholars, only Huang Lizhou can be regarded as a whole body. The last minute of the movie thundered the audience of all classes and tastes in the whole hall, which made people want to say, "I didn't see it. I didn't see anything!" Perhaps this is the end reversal of the legendary enemy Qianjun.
