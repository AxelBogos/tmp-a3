I have seen this movie at least 3 times (the content of the first 40 minutes), the last time is to watch with a person, the latter content has never been seen, it is very funny, anyway, I am not going to see it again, give up. The real events of this kind of Korean movies are very attractive to me, but I don't know why I can't watch them.
This kind of film summed up a sentence is: human nature this thing has never been human, are beasts, talk about human nature!
