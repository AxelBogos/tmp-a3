[such a dazzling trailer, where is the science fiction movie?! I was stunned for 50 minutes, but I didn't realize it had anything to do with science fiction. An hour later the screenwriter told us that the man was a psychopath (you have to say religious Laozi has nothing to say) the hallucination of since when psychosis can also be called a science fiction element. The second half of the time is spent showing off the visual effects of their own garbage, fooling around. ]
