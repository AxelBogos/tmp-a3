Actually, I don't think there is much content! Say if you feel bored. The protagonist doesn't know how to change from weak to core. I don't see that other heroes have a good start. When they hit the dragon, they all play soy sauce except that golden dragon! Add another star because the 3D effect is really good, and the character expression is much better than most domestic 3D animation! Unfortunately, the content is too lame.
