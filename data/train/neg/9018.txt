I really regret going to see it, wasting time, wasting money, laughing, embarrassing, abusing feelings. I just want to ask where rock'n 'roll is. Dapeng, do you have any misunderstanding about rock and roll? I played a whole movie on my cell phone in the cinema for the first time. By comparison, I feel that the "shyness", which is cold and emotionless, can be considered sincere.
