A family inherited (the daughter finally hallucinated) mental illness in the second uncle has been trying to prove that he has an artistic way to return to the past glory, and finally jumped off a building to commit suicide. The long shot that makes people want to puke, the inexplicable soundtrack, the stem that people in the circle can understand. Anyway, this one is not for me.
