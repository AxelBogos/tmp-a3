It seems that I am one of the few people who give an one-star evaluation, so I'd better tell you my reason. If you are friends who have not seen the TV version, you will feel very confused and unable to enter the play. For those of me who have seen the TV version, it is no longer a matter of fried cold rice, but fried sour rice. Not a moving movie is a good movie.
