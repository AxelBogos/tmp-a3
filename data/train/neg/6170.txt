I don't relax at all, just like all domestic comedies, scratching your armpit to make you laugh, you laugh, but not happy at all. Like skits, there is no need to do short dramas. Fortunately, I bought the rights to the script of the girl in red, otherwise it would be so bad. When I heard that the soundtrack played "drunken Folk songs" in the end, it was really unworthy, and the movies with problems with values had nothing to do with the real vulgarity.
