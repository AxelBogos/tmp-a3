Feng Menglong, an excellent secretary of the county party committee, is 60 years old during his four years in office, catching evil tigers, mountain bandits, anti-Japanese invaders, and having an affair with a widow with good color and art, and the halo of the protagonist blinds our dog's eyes. After watching the movie, I always felt that the script was written by Suzhou Pingtan Troupe because it was too much. Outrageous, the money is issued by the Suzhou government, the screen is full of Kunqu opera reviews, the director is a documentary, the rhythm is warm.
