I know this is a work that is analyzed at the textbook level by media majors, but after reading it, I still want to say, what kind of ghost movie is wtf? In less than half of the film, I have already guessed that everyone will tell the story to the most advantageous, heroic and heroic side of himself, that people are selfish. Robbers, women, men, witnesses. Will that woman do anything but cry, scream and laugh? You call this a classic?
