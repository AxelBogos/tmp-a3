The rhythm of this film is quite slow, and the story is old-fashioned, and the only thing to watch is to be interspersed with a lot of Hong Kong flavor, as well as the nonsense of household appliances beating monsters and some dirty bridges. It was breathtaking at the beginning, and the trend behind it, ah! Less than satisfactory, the construction of the robot appears to fish in troubled waters, Shu Xian's paragraph makes people confused, in short, the script should be more refined.
