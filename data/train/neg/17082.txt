Kung Fu Panda Sammo Hung fights the two major gangs of China and Russia. More than sensational, lack of stamina, literary drama, such as an old woman foot-binding, martial arts is short and without splendor, almost all in the trailer. The director has ideas but does not control enough, and there are too many trivialities. It's interesting to watch the old faces of Hong Kong movies come out to speak Northeast dialect. There are too many acquaintances, and in the end, the eggs are good. 2.5/5
