First of all, the story is too bad, Lijiaomiao really only wrote a good work. Everyone knows that the killer will never be Makoto Inoue, but some of the character's behavior is really unimaginable and unexaminable. Secondly, the motive of the real killer is also questionable. The technique of the director is also outdated. Boring movie.
