It's pretty bad, definitely a bad movie. Plot procrastination, the whole 1.25 times faster, but also a pure waste of time, the plot has no logic and meaning, at sixes and sevens. Can tell the story clearly is not too bad, according to this basic standard, this is an absolutely bad film, even 6.7 points, it is strange! Shu Qi's heavy makeup for killing Matt can hardly be seen. I don't know if Shu Qi can't bear to look directly at it now.
