I have copied too much painting style, and my original painting is ugly. The plot is mentally retarded, for people under the age of ten. My nephew just entered junior high school and left midway when he saw it. Do you still call yourself a dark horse? Font has such a bad reputation that even the amusement park is cool. Besides, this film is better than "fragments"? Six points. Originally two stars, false height, changed to one star.
