Male pig is NC+ scum, all rob banks and get something for nothing and think that they have incomparable integrity, no ability and no merit, and even the usual fighting tasks of the protagonist are handed over to the male two who are one lap younger than him. This movie is estimated to be Mary Sue, who was killed by writer or director YY, and was suddenly found to have superpowers by 75 imps. Wow, turn over! Come on, who's going to wake up the director and screenwriter?
