Recently always looking at the living room, twelve angry men, the perfect stranger, this man is from the earth. A group of people chatted in a room for more than an hour, but compared with the first two books, the earth really doesn't interest me. History textbook knowledge is really boring. Why are people always angry about things they can't understand. Finally, the design of "I am your father" is still very bright.
