To tell the truth, after watching so many horror movies, the gap between domestic films is still very big, the lens and editing are very amateur, and I will not talk about fake props. Generally speaking, they are sincere but not attentive enough. In view of the national conditions, mainland horror films are really difficult to play, and a high-quality film "Green Nightmare" has been produced over the years.
