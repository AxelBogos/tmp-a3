I think the era of the Yellow Emperor was barbaric, bloody, cruel, tribal slaughter, fighting for territory, and the dawn of civilization appeared. I feel that the film is barbaric and bloody, the actors are not wild enough, and the modern theme thinking has penetrated into that era, which is boring.
