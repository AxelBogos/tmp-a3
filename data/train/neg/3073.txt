It is true that it is easy to use dialogue to advance the story, but there is only noise and noise in the film for nearly two hours, ignoring the life of some of the protagonists who should be told as a film or as a biography. So, all that's left is boredom, emptiness, boredom, and even irritability. Only one star for Winslet's performance.
