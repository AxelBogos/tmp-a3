At first, I was amazed by the peacock. When I saw the end, I didn't remember that the peacock was shot by the director. I thought it was another film. The director's Indian complex is too heavy, and the actress's insipid and nuclear-free acting skills are pieced together in bits and pieces, but fortunately he has nibbled on a good book. Ps:JRM or stop acting in costumes, black circles under the eyes explode head zombie face, casting director, makeup maker don't tease, okay?
