The visual wonders and combat designs are amazing! But this suffocating plot makes people only hate Douban without a negative score. It is understandable that the director thinks that the audience likes to watch cool scenes, but how can there be empathy even if the motivation of the character's behavior is unclear or contradictory? If this film sells well, will there be more things that burn attentively to mixed scissors and use feet to arc characters and treat the audience as mentally handicapped? I was so scared that I quickly played a star.
