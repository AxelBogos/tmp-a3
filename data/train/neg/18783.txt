The brain is really big, give Xiao Zaokawa so much inner play? The war scene is extremely disappointing, and the contradictions between Tokugawa, the cheap Yue Party and Ishida are basically mentioned at once, but they focus on describing the village flowers who claim to be dogs and 30% of the alternative love stories. If you have so much fucking time to shoot this bullshit, you might as well add it to the Fuji Battle. The name does not match. Passers-by who don't know Japanese history think that 30% of the good people watch this movie.
