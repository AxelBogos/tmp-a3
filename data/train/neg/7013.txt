In the five episodes, the abandoned actress pretends to be aloof and likes to be vexatious, the man takes the initiative to roar, the anger quotient is low, and the two men are childish and irresponsible. The 9.1 score of Douban can really make people from full of expectation to great disappointment. However, when I saw that the brain disabled drama also had such a high score, I was relieved that I would not have to watch Douban's score in the future.
