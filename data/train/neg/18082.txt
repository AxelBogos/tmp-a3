Dan Maze, who made Sarah Cohen's films, is directed by Dan Maze, so it's not surprising that de Niro's role basically continues the "gangster family" model, and then he goes in the same direction in "good guys." in fact, I think this kind of role is the highlight of de Niro. The setting of the first half of the film is expected to be more sufficient, and it begins to be modeled in the later stage. Of course, there are also some funny points scattered, but the degree is still weak.
