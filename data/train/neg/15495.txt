The first part is very ridiculous, if not for a few strong support, this film will not be interesting, but it can be a bad film, until the money is full of money to start the real story, Liam Neeson is still not appropriate to play a crazy personality. Sharto Copley's neurotic feeling is great. The dramatic change in the ending is very much in line with this nonsense.
