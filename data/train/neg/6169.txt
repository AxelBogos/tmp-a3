When I finish three films in two days over the weekend, the biggest feeling is that radio and television should not be blamed for bad horror films. What can't be refined and can't have ghosts? look at these nine stories, which one has no ghosts, but which one is scary? Of course, every story takes place at night, and it must be related to three o'clock in the morning, so it is really not easy for the storyteller to make it up, so this is another series that continues to go downhill, and it is estimated that there will be no more 4. It is said that there is no connection between the stories at all. in fact, there is no connection between the stories at all. what is more, because of the short length, all kinds of bluffing ghosts appear too quickly, without suspense and unknown, and the sense of natural fear is very weak. the first part is already very bad, but the setting of the first two stories is very novel, and the third story is a blind reversal regardless of logic. Moreover, it opened the strange mode of "the person who was with me died a long time ago". Many of the latter two stories have been used, and they all cannot stand scrutiny and lack of details. In addition, the special effects are very bad and lack the courage and ability to face the violent scenes. The latter two stories of the third part also started the "literature and art" mode, which is boring!
