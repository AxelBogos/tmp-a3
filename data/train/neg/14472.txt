There's nothing more boring than that. Plot deja vu, a typical foreign dementia loser, may not like the lead actor Eisenberg, the film began to feel a little disgusted. But with the advance of the plot, there is no surprise, mediocre, boring to replace everything. Feeling the director's ambition, I wanted to make an unusual and weird thriller, but the finished product was very disappointing. What surprised me was the cameo of Uncle J Macsis.
