Four hours of the film is too long, and Scarlett is too ugly, so let India play it. There are not many bright spots in the story, beautifying the slaves of the southern army to black slaves is offensive, maliciously vilify the northern army. A woman who has been a widow twice is so popular. Red's fatherly image is outstanding, but he is the one who killed Bonnie. Melanie, the goddess of perfection, is admirable. And Scarlett's last line has become an eternal classic.
