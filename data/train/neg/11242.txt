I finished watching it at dinner. I feel that the whole arrangement is very strange, the heroine is a strange loser, the handsome hero is strangely in love with her, and the strange thing about the soy sauce girl is that lace still loves the heroine, and the whole joke is very strange. Is the legendary British humor like this in chicken movies. It's not that we haven't seen the death at the funeral, nor have we been cold enough to laugh. Anyway, after watching it, we are speechless.
