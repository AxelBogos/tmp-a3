Let's be clear about the truth. The picture and music are worth five stars. Such a grand picture can not tell a good story, deduct a star. The screenwriter created such an evil woman with three values, angrily withholding a star. It is even more disgusting for people to deduct one star from selling their feelings in 3D. Finally, very personally, I watch a movie casually in my spare time, and it pisses me off. I don't care if I want to deduct another star. Will shit change because of art music? No, it's still a piece of shit.
