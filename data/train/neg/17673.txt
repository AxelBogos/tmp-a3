The script is solid and the suspense is ingenious, but the character is weak (which is also a common fault in Japanese dramas). Second, the character's behavior lacks logic and often jumps from one extreme to the other, so when the character begins to regret or reflect, he is not moved or heartbroken, but: your mind has finally returned to normal.
