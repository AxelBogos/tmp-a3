Alas. After a Golden Horse Movie, the other acting looked good. I thought it was a film from a long time ago, but it was still 8012. My mother asked me why I watched such a boring movie. Also, I thought the horse's double eyelids were quite natural, but the double eyelids in this film were as swollen as if they had just been operated on. (ps said that I quite like horses, pps is very eager to survive. (forgot to mention, the last silhouette is quite good, the whole film is the best! Finally, "get out" turned out to be my favorite mantra, but some people took it seriously.
