This Nima is a horror movie, it is simply an upgraded version of the spoon killer. I really sympathize with the villains. If an indestructible fly haunts me all day, I will kill myself. But compared with the hostess, the villain is at least freed early. Do women mainly spend their whole lives with flies? You said that you didn't change into a cat or something after your second reincarnation, but it was still a fly, and the hostess enjoyed it, and those damn songs and dances, I will never watch Indian movies again.
