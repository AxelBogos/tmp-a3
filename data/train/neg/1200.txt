Let's talk about the good things first. the acting skills of the actors are still online, especially Zhang Jicong's role is the most interesting in the film. In addition, I was surprised to see 5 Mao special effects in the cinema in 9012, and the mattress cried near the end. The series has reached the point where it all depends on the popularity and box office calls of the consumer actors. Another hard injury is editing, transition and so on are rather stiff, some people may say "Hong Kong style", but what I see is that the technique is not enterprising just to quickly circle the money, as if there is a bad storyteller who only tells you the time and place of the main characters, and make up for the rest of your brain!
