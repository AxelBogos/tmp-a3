It should have been given three stars. After all, I like the setting of the Corner of Vengeance very much, but what is the ghost that is so inexplicably filmed? what is the ghost of such a small and fresh Korean TV series? the overall situation is interspersed with inexplicable shock points. I'm not surprised at all. Hey. The whole world fell in love with the heroine, but fortunately the heterosexual couple didn't come back to life.
