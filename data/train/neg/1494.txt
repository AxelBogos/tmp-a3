I just want to say that the shooting of something really can not be worse, it is simply subversion, but subversion also has to have a process, directly cut the process and present the results. Also, the part of the fight between Tang long and Jiang Lao, "what's behind you, what's behind you", was repeated four or five times in a row. I thought I had a card.
