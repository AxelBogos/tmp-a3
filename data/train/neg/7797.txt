I'm sorry to add the label of Luc Besson. Crazy. I can't believe the 7.3 score is unbelievable. Dare not be less than 5.5 in the future. If it's not lower than me, I don't believe in Douban. The bad ones make people laugh to death. How does this make bug and pretending to be a teaching film? the heroine doesn't commit suicide in the end, how can it be worthy of the audience! Fortunately, it cost one yuan to see it.
