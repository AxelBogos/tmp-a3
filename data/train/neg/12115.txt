The plot is so low that I can hardly see the acting skills of these people, and the picture and atmosphere rendering can all be ignored, because I can't see the brilliance of a story that directly attacks human nature. Anyway, I just don't like this film. I have a serious lack of intelligence and have no layout. Fast forward.
