Ideal is really good, the setting of subway collapse flooding is really good, until all the escapees were electrocuted, it was wonderful and tense. However, the director, screenwriter and some actors were really stupid to the extreme. Under the disaster, the protagonist and his party slowly chatted about their daily life, did not rush to escape, and had a big fight with their cheating rivals, plus some silly talking companions, the plot was not reasonable at all, plus all kinds of divine music, it was really a waste of this GOOD idea.
