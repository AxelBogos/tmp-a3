A gentleman's secret order. It sounds better! Ah, the script that Gai wrote when he had diarrhea. The plot of the characters is so boring. What's more fatal is that speaking English with too many strange accents affects the impression. Even the soundtrack is not very good. Will there be a second film? Why do you hide so many details at the end of the film? There's something wrong with casting. Illya doesn't look like a powerful, violent monster.
