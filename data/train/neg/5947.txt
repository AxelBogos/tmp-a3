The detonator can only watch the first 30 minutes of the film. The plot laying and suspense rendering in the first 30 minutes of the film was really great, but it completely collapsed after 30 minutes. The plot, human setting and all aspects of the performance are extremely embarrassing! This is not an ordinary gunner, but a grass-roots male agent! Disappointed! Negative review! Ps: waste a bunch of good actors!
