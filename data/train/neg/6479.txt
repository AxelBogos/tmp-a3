It's really 10,000 grass-mud horses growling big bad movies, big bad movies! I can sum it up in one sentence, that is, a killer comes to a strange place, assembles a weapon, fucks a woman and falls in love with her and finally gets killed! Nima! Nima! Uncle George, what's wrong, Uncle George?! And the producer, Nima! Are you crazy poor? do you have to ruin yourself like this, Nima?!
