Hijacking contraband, selling feelings. Not only the director of the film, but also the crazy praise of the audience in Douban. The plot is childish, the stale groceries accumulate, and the actors are ugly. What feelings ah, besides seeing a few games you have played and movies you have seen, what else can you tell me? I even know what's on your mind: look! I've played this game before! I have seen this movie! I know this stem! All the great director's movies have acted these things. How good I am!
