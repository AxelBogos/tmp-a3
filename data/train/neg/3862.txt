Everyone loves the heroine series. A series of murders caused by the brain of mass spermatozoa. The story is disorganized, and the two male pigs are simply mentally retarded. The love of the demon cat is so noble, more noble than all others, and it doesn't matter for those innocent prostitutes to die casually. The extremely selfish "love" is really disgusting. In the heyday of the Tang Dynasty, when he did not feel "prosperous" in the movies, he felt that the juggling level of the circus in the Tang Dynasty was among the best in the world. More rubbish than Wuji.
