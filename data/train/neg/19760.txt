Actually, this kind of.. It's good to see the screenshot, but when you watch the movie.. Angels on the stage love beauty or something. It can't be compared. Even if I like Vivian so much, Amelie is much more vivid and beautiful. So what exactly is this movie about? legs are better, faces are more beautiful and happiness is easier, right? In that case, I agree.
