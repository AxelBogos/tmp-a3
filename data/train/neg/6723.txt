I gave up when I saw entering India. In that paragraph in Shanghai, I only understood one sentence of Shanghainese, but I didn't understand any of the other "Chinese" sentences, and I felt that the scene was also false. In addition, the part in India feels even more unbelievable, and I don't want to watch it, the first film I can't watch in 2014.
