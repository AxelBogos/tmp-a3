I really don't see any bright spots in an extramarital affair. In fact, it's not bad, but no matter which part, it has been played too many times. I feel like I put the classic part of extramarital affair together. Even the beginning is similar to the Tokyo Tower, which is a Japanese extramarital affair movie much better than this play.
