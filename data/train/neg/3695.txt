The story of du Yuesheng was completely ruined by Wang Jing. Perhaps because of Liu Weiqiang's producer (once directed by "Jingwu Fengyun Chen Zhen"), the film held high the banner of patriotism, and Chow Yun-fat was possessed like Donnie yen and became an anti-Japanese who sacrificed himself to become benevolent. I can't stand the passage and drama of the film. Wang Jing's evening scene is very much like Li Hanxiang, crudely copying himself. Wang Jing, don't make any more movies, so as not to continue to create rubbish and cast more Xu Anhua movies.
