American interpersonal family and other elements are interspersed in all types of American films. American culture can be seen in different American films. 165 minutes of filming of this film is really too long. Mason, the protagonist after the age of 15, lacks vitality. But it does not affect our understanding of the changes of ordinary American families. Personally, I think it is not as good as the American series.
