Even if cf is a lifelong fan of true love, I have to say that the choice of screenplay is not flattering. What exactly is the director trying to say? I don't know at all. I was fooled to see the end. Are you kidding me? It took the director more than 90 minutes to show his interest, aesthetic vision and taste as gay. He was very good at provoking gay's desire, and even laughed at himself. In other words, he was selling corruption with the plot.
