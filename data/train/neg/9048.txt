Seeing the decomposition of the plot by Xu Jiao's brain-disabled fans on Douban, I just want to say: which dog's eye has seen a scary cruise ship-style plot unfolded? Please forget it. Don't insult the terrorist cruise ship, okay? This is not the same level at all, okay? Don't be so shameless and lean on a good movie, okay? Xu Jiao was blackmailed and killed by you stupid fans, okay? This is a bad movie!
