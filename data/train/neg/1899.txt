It feels like every character is mentally retarded. Seeing that the devil didn't drive away, he had to get out of the car and have a look at the head. The protagonist's family is hidden in the basement, do not make a sound ah, do not call the police (feel that none of the protagonist's family has a mobile phone), must fire a shot to the upstairs floor to expose the location. After the enchanted gun rolled down the stairs, the protagonist did not mend the knife, but directly threw the gun over the demon to run. This is all coquettish intelligence. It's the worst movie I've seen in recent years, and it's logically broken. Finally, I highly recommend that everyone go to see it. I can't suffer this alone!
