What the hell?? The whole process was very embarrassing and there was no smile at all. The theme was vulgar and stayed until the end, thinking that there would be a big reversal.

Is this to satisfy all the middle-aged uncles, their inner delusions? The most frightening thing to think about is that this plot makes people feel that as long as you have money, fools can be rich even if you invest. Are you sure?
