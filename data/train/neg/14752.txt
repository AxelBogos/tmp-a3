I don't know what to say from beginning to end! A cross-dress show brought by UFO, in addition to hacking to death a fat motorcycle man and seems to have eaten his meat later, but I can't find any scary place, a typical title party wow! However, there are still some noteworthy places, the 1970s can show that is not recognized by the secular non-mainstream elements, homosexuality transvestite, large-length music is actually not bad! And the BT actor facial expression show makes me think it's funny.
