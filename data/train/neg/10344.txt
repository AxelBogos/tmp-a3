This is the first time to watch Marvel Comics movie at the original speed. It can be said to be very disappointed. The characters are all developing downwards on a given route, the protagonist is to become a hero, the enemy is to give the protagonist a level of existence, and a gag is added in the middle. If this is already the highest level of marvel, it is really unflattering. I don't know what it feels like to see it on the big screen, but it really hurts that the development of the story is too easy to guess and illogical.
