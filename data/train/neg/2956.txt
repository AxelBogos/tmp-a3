The change was so bad that it didn't get into the woman's heart at all. In the first scene, the heroine was wrong, and there was no mystery in the original work; it was even more wrong for her fiance to really love her, and it was in this world that she fell into the abyss step by step; the final arrest and suicide were speechless, and there was a lot of room for imagination for the original work to rest on her shoulder; and the core critical consumerism of the original work was completely deleted? Aunt Miyabe will probably be furious when she sees it.
