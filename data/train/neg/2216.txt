The story setting and action play are OK, but the lack of groundwork in the early plot will make it appear that the plot on the human side is too retarded, and the opening of the film is so poisonous that people don't want to look down at all, and even make people have the impulse to play a star. Fortunately, the later action scenes make up for the mentally retarded shortcomings of the plot, and it is no problem to play two stars. But I was disgusted by the opening plot. It's really not worth playing two stars. Let's play one star.
