…… I didn't finish it. A very interesting topic, but a very boring way to tell it. Is it really the work of a skilled director? Rely too much on language, it is a waste of the form of film. The script itself has a hard wound. If the film wants to be academic, the stupidest way is to express it and simplify it in words, and it takes up all of it. All KK had to do was put up a sign saying I was acting hysterical. Hard work, no talent.
