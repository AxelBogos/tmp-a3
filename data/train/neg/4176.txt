I expected that the quality of this film would be poor, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. The plot is dull, the special effects are false, and the acting is exaggerated. Good materials to make shit, in recent years, the Japanese cartoon into live-action movies have been very successful? Especially those who are famous for their original works. Oh, [Ranger Jianxin] is not bad. I hope the dream eaters will make some achievements in the future.
