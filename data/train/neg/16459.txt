They are not like each other. As a thriller, most of them are routines from decades ago, and I feel bored when I don't watch horror movies very much; as a suspense film, there is no logic, and the motives of clowns are really puzzling; they are OK as an educational film, but the images of their parents are a little facial, and aren't those kids growing up too fast? It's like he suddenly overcame his fear... I wish it were so easy.
