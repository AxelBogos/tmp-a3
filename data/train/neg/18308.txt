Putting aside the weak plot, too many and unnecessary cutting scenes (note that it is not bloody, but constantly cutting) is extremely uncomfortable to watch. Blurred good and evil, morality and even logic make people feel that it is just a group of wild animals biting each other. As for the unexpected ending, some people say it is a bright spot, which I think is vulgar, and it is also the final evidence of being positioned as a popcorn movie.
