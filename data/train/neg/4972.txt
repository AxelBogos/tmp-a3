In addition to the 3.2 score of "the Great cause of the Founding of the Party", which was not shown in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, I finally found another 3-rated film on Douban. Yes, the director of this film is innovative and goes to cult to pay homage to "two Big smokers", but the ending is nothing more than excellent and extremely bad. Unfortunately, this film has gone to a very bad extreme, with shit-like dubbing and inexplicable character design. It can't get any worse. I don't explain it for a star.
