The rough and random production was revealed in the first scene, but I still insisted on reading the main line of "Why Guo Degang was kidnapped by Chen Guokun". The script can be regarded as nothing, and several roles are set up by people who pick up ready-made. a group of northeasterners surround the lineup of three crosstalk. Zhang Xiaofei looked at Allen for a moment, and there were also good-looking girls in dragon sets, and it was no disobedience to Bean's expression and action embedded in it. The overall production is still too rough.
