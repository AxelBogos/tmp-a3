I can understand the flamboyant atmosphere deliberately created by the director, in which the inexplicable plot can be accepted, but the unattractive lines and performances such as a bunch of people are really boring, and the play and story are not only stupid, but the audience waited for a long time and finally waited for the final battle, but the octopus was defeated in this way. It can be said that the discontent of the whole film was ignited by the audience.
