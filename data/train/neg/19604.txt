After reading some descriptions of the original work, the adaptation is really very deceptive. How ironic it is to ask a man to adapt a woman's work or a feminist work! After watching the movie, I have to sigh: raising a girl is really about being rich and broadening your horizons, so as not to be sold out by a small favor. Why is this story so suitable for our situation in China? Ah, it seems that there is no escape from this strange circle of education anywhere.
