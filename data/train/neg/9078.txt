Joyfully complaining with the chairman and the panda in Wanda. I feel that the film is full of fun, the truth is not profound, the love doesn't make sense, and the plot is full of mistakes. The child's play is awkward. The literature and art of the lines are like the written language, in a vain attempt to connect the relationship with a novel, no more Mary Su, the first five minutes feel to predict the ending, 30 minutes to overturn the original prediction to the real ending. Feel sorry for the ticket money.
