I felt a little funny when I saw someone say it was the best movie in the series. To be honest, I think this is the worst of the four films at present, not to mention the plot in which the IQ is not negative and never higher than zero, Lin Delu's dumbfounded narrative, especially the mentally retarded rhythm of this film, I already want to swear. Not to mention the film slot Qido, Deng Lixin's chrysanthemum-like acting skills also brought out the second half of the serious collapse of the film, TV actors are also unusually abrupt, Zheng Jiaying exerted too hard as if constipation for a long time. In order to make a movie for money laundering, we invited a group of tepid stars plus the necessary philanthropist Louis Koo, and then piled up the commercial elements on the screen. That's why I called it extremely smart in my first essay, because this kind of film will always have an audience and a market. But the whole is really mentally retarded, the whole fast forward is disgusting, mediocre to bad, mediocre, really depends on the foil, by contrast, I miss Wang Jing. The only thing that makes people feel comfortable is Liao Qizhi and Lu Haipeng. Only the two of them know that they are actors.
