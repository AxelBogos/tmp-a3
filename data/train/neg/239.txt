It is not a remake but a sequel, which explains that 1 million of the beard buried in the movie was accidentally encountered by others, but the plot of the whole play is very absurd. Although the beginning of each episode repeatedly emphasizes that this is a real event, who tm believes you? Everyone is not a normal person, and the small roles are numerous and have nothing to do with the theme, just to make up for 10 episodes, as if they are releasing black humor but boring from time to time! It doesn't hurt to jump from episode 5 to 10, it's a world of difference compared with the movie.
