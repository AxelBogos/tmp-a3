…… For the first time, I saw someone make the subtitles so formulaic, which is even more explicit than the narration of A Dream of Red Mansions. As for love, pure is pure, but it is not the cleanest.

On the basis of the fairy tales of a rich young master and Cinderella, it is proved that the world's money and fatal diseases are the immutable truth of chasing women in pseudo-love films.
