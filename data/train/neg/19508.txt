Sure enough, the most interesting is the pair of Liu Milk Tea and Xueyou Brother. It's also the funniest (never selfishly). I just think that Liu Xiaonu and Xueyou brother have too little part in the play. It's not fun at all. Maybe my expectations are too high to say that I have a good look, but on the whole I am more satisfied. At least not disappointed. Ha ha ha. I also found that I don't like star platter in movies with milk tea.
