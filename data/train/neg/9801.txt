The whole process of an expressionless sad face is to see the state of this film, how can it be so ugly! It's so hard to laugh! The plot is stiff, the joke is awkward! The only PAPI I want to see, you'd better make your own funny little video! Really! One is worth ten! Suddenly I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema. I'll be angry to death in my seat. )
