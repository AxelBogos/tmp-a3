1. Multi-vision + screen / window separation + mute to create a sense of alienation; protagonist standard Putonghua + supporting dialect, strong psychological optimism + sad life actors' performance is incompatible with the role setting, the screen / window emperor under the cultural differences between the East and the West, the best acting of the non-black ➡️ full film is Wang Yuan in the first timeline.

3. Non-linear time and space staggered narrative mode + life approachable detail treatment = filmed "Golden Marriage" in the way of "the Last Night of the Earth", it's a long story.
4. Unexpectedly, the landing point is "campus" bullying. Li Haiyan's guilt all her life should be carried by Guo Jingming. "the living can still suffocate the urine", is this the core colloquial phrase of the new era in China?
