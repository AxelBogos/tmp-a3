The year of the Rooster was repainted on New year's Eve. I saw it six years ago, but I don't remember it. There is a long way to go, and there is no trace of wild geese. Over the past few years, they have done a lot of repetitive things, and they seem to have done nothing and stagnated there. Every time I sum up my feelings, I seem to grow up, but next time I still go the way I walked before and make the mistakes I have made. Is the nature difficult to change, or busy, the head is chaotic, can not find the result. In 2017, I hope I will live in peace and clearness.
