Originally thought to have the potential to make China's magic IP, but also expected to jump on the street. The sense of narrative fragmentation is extremely serious, the logic is broken, and the content of the story is insufficient, so we can only rely on special effects. The scene was also quite uncreative, and it was too primary-age to think that a monster would suddenly jump out and scare people. The motive that supported Hu Bayi to find the secret of the nine-story demon tower regardless of life and death was only for love, and the lack of emotional groundwork led to a complete lack of persuasion and credibility.
