As an entertainment comedy meets the passing criteria, the complete characters in the story are basically unannoying. Although it takes the "game" form of "who is serious first and who loses first" as a series, in the end, it still returns to the "main theme" of "feelings need to really pay". Only the confession at the end adds to the hypocrisy of domestic dramas. This story is remade from a South Korean film.
