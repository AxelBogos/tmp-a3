There seems to be everything, but there seems to be nothing. In the narrative film, it must not be Lao Li's best work. Ah, by the way, there is that complaint, which is interesting just to see, but it is a little baffling when it connects with the whole story. I really don't see how a drug dealer who is going to prison can complain about bin Laden who has nothing to do with him. I can only say that Americans are patriots. Mm-hmm. It must be so.
