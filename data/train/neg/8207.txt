Absolute blockbuster, super blockbuster! I've never seen such a great movie, a complete director's one-man show. If I can get a score of 0, I will never score a point! 000000000 . You'll know it when you see it! Those who give high praise are those who are trapped and want to drag everyone into it. Throughout the whole process, an actor is walking around in space, teaching films.
