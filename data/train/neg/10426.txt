In a very mediocre healing film, there doesn't seem to be much difference between before and after the trip, and the protagonist doesn't have much insight, but mends a rift of friendship. However, the victory lies in the beautiful scenery, and the small fights between the two old men along the way are also very interesting and witty. Well-behaved, two and a half stars.
