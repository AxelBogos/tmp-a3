1.5 at first, I thought it was a customs clearance game film, but it turned out to be an ethical feature film, then it became a big problem, those too many holes-riddled plot bug, characters' inexplicable behavior logic can not be ignored and can not be forgiven. This kind of film with strong speculative nature and intense plot wrestling is not suitable for the three pools where personal interest wins.
