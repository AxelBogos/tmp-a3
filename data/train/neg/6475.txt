The main line of the story has no idea what it is. There are too many lines. The most terrible thing is that when human nature is about to develop for the better, it has not changed and completely gone. Lin Lingdong's aesthetics of violence can not be found at all. No character is necessary. Since we have cobbled together so many roles, is it impossible to spend money? having cobbled together a group of stars and performed such a so-called drama, I really can't see what to say.
