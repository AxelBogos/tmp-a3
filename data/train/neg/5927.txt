It feels like watching a fake Star Wars movie, another series that takes too big steps to create a Star Wars universe. The prequel story in this episode is as boring as it sounds, forcibly cobbled together the time of a movie with an action play, forced all kinds of fake best parts, and the characters were anxiously pushed by the plot, and finally directly turned the action play into a noise in the ear. It's boring to forcibly expand an idea into a movie for the sake of the concept of the universe.
