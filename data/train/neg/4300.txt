Is this a crime of high intelligence? Suspense? Every time it is a strange blood-killing plot; the fool hanging in this bar knew he had a fight as soon as he saw bruises all over his face, and the police officer came seriously and killed me and laughed directly in the cinema. Isn't that nonsense? there is also a clip of riding a bike out of the house, unexpectedly riding a bike to put a cigarette on the way away. I won't mention the criminal logic. Even if a blind man identifies him to make a phone call, it doesn't matter what evidence. A blind handsome guy killed each other in his decorated home without even looking at the obvious evidence, and a bunch of magical steel balls.
