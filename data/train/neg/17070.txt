I don't know what it will be like if I really come into contact with alien life in the future. now human beings are afraid and nervous about this, and the whole state of mind has to be faced with and somewhat unwilling. What will it be like if they really find it? maybe there are not many intelligent creatures in the universe. Thank God you don't invade people.
