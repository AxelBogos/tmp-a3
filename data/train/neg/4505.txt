I haven't seen such a boring movie for a long time. I abandoned it in an hour. NP is beautiful, but unlike Jacqueline at all, she has no resemblance in figure, appearance, behavior, speech, and strange artificial accent. She appears to have never been in the play at all. The story can be told more about her family background, 3,000 pairs of shoes, happy birthday to the president and Monroe, and remarrying the Greek ship king.
