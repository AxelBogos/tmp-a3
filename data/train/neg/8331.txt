Hong Kong movies are so depressed? Lin Xue and Wu Zhenyu both came to the mainland to cheat money without dubbing. Weird Hong Kong Putonghua, but Lin Xue speaks Henan and Tianjin dialect is very funny. The last scene I saw seemed to be the piece of land north of the North third Ring Road of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, a small surprise. 2012.08.11
