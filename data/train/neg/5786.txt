Because... I hate all kinds of "reinventing words", so. From movies to translators, on the contrary, I completely become a nuisance. From the point of view of my "serious and rigorous" personal understanding, it is really too "vulgar", "disgusting" and "bad taste". If the Japanese want to use this kind of teasing to raise the middle finger to Japan's national conditions, the onlookers, I guess, are all Yamano villagers who do not have televisions at home. Second, it's killing people.
