15X 100 wanted to film the disaster, but ended up photographing himself as a disaster. The characters quarrel endlessly and forcefully against each other without laying the groundwork for cause and effect, which makes people wonder why human beings put their fate in the hands of this group of people. The thriller scene is designed to be extremely perfunctory, which makes people want to laugh. The actress's over-performing expression should be the scariest part of the film. Even if Netflix doesn't have the reputation of care movies, it can't buy a semi-finished product to go home.
