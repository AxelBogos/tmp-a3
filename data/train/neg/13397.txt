I just watched a few bear-infested cartoon clips with my little niece before, and this is the first time I have come into full contact with this animated film. To tell you the truth, the image of Xiong Da Xiong er is really not good-looking. I even feel scared every time I open my mouth, especially those teeth. When I was a child, Xiong Da Xiong er, except for a small head, was not cute at all. Bald head is strong and feels like a snow village. The only two points I can see in the whole film are the brother and sister relationship between the cute little wild boar and Feifei (although it is also simple primary-age, but somehow poked me). In addition, when Fei Fei came out, I thought it was a cat. My male friend said it should be a dog, but I didn't expect it to be a wolf.
