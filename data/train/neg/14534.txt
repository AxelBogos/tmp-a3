Incompetent parents don't deserve to have children? The screenwriter and director specially asked the little boy who starred in the film to express this point of view at the end of the film, as if he could be righteous. Is this society really reduced to Darwinian rules for the distribution of hierarchy and power? The film distributes food through charities, law enforcement departments actively crack down on gangs and evils, and public welfare activists organize prison condolences. A series of plots portray the society and the government as a virgin, but downplay or avoid the social and policy issues that lead to the poverty of refugees or new immigrants. Dirty water is spilled on poor, ignorant, selfish families and parents. Is this what the movie thinks of justice? Although the end of the film gives the mother a chance to appeal in court-people who have not experienced it are not qualified to judge! However, under the plot arrangement of the whole film, this rebuttal appears so weak that it can be easily ignored by ordinary viewers. These are probably the real reasons for the discomfort I felt after watching the movie for the first time-not the tragic fate of the little boy, but the contempt, stigmatization and accusation of Darwinian devotees to the vulnerable groups.
