Rich, powerful and time-rich dignitaries, paparazzi spent money to complete the maiden flight of a luxury plane, accidentally encountered a thunderstorm forced to fail to land on a mysterious island, and finally completed a fucking escape. I watch this movie purely because there is a friend of a friend in moments who is a screenwriter. My heart is actually hehe.
