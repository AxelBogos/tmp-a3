This film is difficult to define. It was supposed to be a relaxed sightseeing comedy, suitable for watching after tired work. Never thought about it, but it was a black, evil movie. A man and a woman, in the long-distance journey, presented their own abnormal and crazy side. After reading it, I just want to say one word, shit!
