I peed all the way, and I watched a broken taxi for more than 10 minutes at the beginning.
Tom Cruise, who plays the killer, pushes him all the way.
The fighting scene was extremely dull.
The camera lens is very bad, boring and boring.
The blockbuster was supposed to be a battle of wits between the killer and the protagonist into chicken soup for the aged soul.
Oh.
It's a pity that there are some big actors in it.
Why does Douban get 7.4 points for this junk movie?!
