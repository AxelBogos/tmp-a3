It's hard to see! What bullshit script? What stupid lines? What sleepwalking narrative? Trisway, the director and screenwriter, is not as simple as film aesthetics. He has no ability to tell stories at all, and he has no idea how to create the atmosphere and tension that criminal films should have. The whole movie is a group of mentally retarded people playing hide-and-seek in the snow. The police have no tactics, the criminals do not cooperate, the plot is driven entirely by stupidity, and the design and scheduling of action plays are even more desperate. To borrow one of Huang Jue's favorite lines, "stupid!"
