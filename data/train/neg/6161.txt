Sporadic. This is simply a depraved history of Camille's destruction of Rodin, whose sexual addiction broke out. After Ajiani and Binoche, the new Camille is obviously under too much pressure to perform, but director Jacques Duvalon prefers it, and even the protagonist Rodin can only often appear sideways, completely wasting Vincent Linton's excellence. Everything is like a disaster.
