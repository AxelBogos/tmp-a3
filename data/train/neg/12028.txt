I haven't read a novel, but I think a novel will be better than a movie. Many of the long-range scenes in the movie are very grandiose, with all the main lines around square wood and other characters very thin. As far as acting skills are concerned, Deng Chao is well-behaved and Ruan Chaochang plays. Although Miss Liu can see that she is trying to act, she is still at the bottom. The love play between the man and the woman is good. Liu Shishi is an actress who dispel my love with acting whenever I have a crush on her in my life.
