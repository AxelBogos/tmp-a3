What is it? the technology is good, but it is completely different! A few days ago, I saw a movie named "Dignity Colony" starring Emma Watson. It was a perverted story that took place in Chile during the Nazi period, similar to a concentration camp. And the Wolf's Nest tells the story of the Dignity Colony! It's just that the technique was filmed in the form of animated clay and so on. Maybe this is the first pure horror cartoon I've ever seen in my lifetime. The use of technology is at its peak, but it is extremely boring as a whole. Although it is only more than 70 minutes, I still want to say, "Master, I really can't enjoy this thing!" Europeans, sometimes it is only suitable for Europe!
