Unfortunately, I am watching a super junk version, which is not high definition, and the dubbing seems to have been secretly filmed in the cinema, which may directly lead to my insensitivity to this film. No acting, no transition, no beauty, no luxury, even the plot is too far-fetched, three people embezzled other people's identity luggage jewelry, unexpectedly a few words over, broken subtitle garbage! I can understand it. It didn't even translate right!
