Perverted, grotesque, ugly, without beauty. The pace is slow. The heroine is ugly. The masked cloth stamped with a circuit enters the hearts of others through wiring devices, treats the schizophrenic little boy, and tries to learn the whereabouts of the victim from the psychopath killer. Speaking in a whispering tone is unbearable. "I'm in charge of my territory" is funny. The end result is that the spy finds a symbol from the killer's heart and deduces the location of the victim to be successfully rescued.
