This Spanish cartoon is really crappy. It's not up to the average Hollywood standard. I don't know if the title of the film is called the Dragon Rider on purpose. In fact, it has nothing to do with the dragon trainer at all. Inspirational is not profound. There is something wrong with the hero's painting style. The discussion of the law is not in depth. There's no room for fun. A little bit looking forward to production.
