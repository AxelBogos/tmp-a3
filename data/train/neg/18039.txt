As a psychic film, it really doesn't give me a high score, even if I use the most common water, it doesn't leave me any sense of fear. It can be said that it is even more boring than domestic horror movies, but the score of 6.8 is much higher than the domestic score of 2. It seems that Chinese people are showing the connotation and belittling local films. It seems that maternal love has triumphed over everything. Please make it clear that this is not a pure love movie laugh.
