I can accept "Zombie Bride" because it is attractive, but after that I can only feel tired when I watch "Christmas Eve shock". No matter how good the music is, it can't save the boring and garrulous simple song and dance of the story. The painting style is not suitable for me. I really didn't finish it. I'm sorry.
Another: it should not be Halloween shock?
