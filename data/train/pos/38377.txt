Many unknown actors, but it is really a very warm love movie, because the name of the film is very cliche, the poster is very cliche, so at first I thought it was another bullshit junk film that earned eyeballs by exposure, but it will get better and better. The more you watch, the warmer you get. It is easy to miss or misunderstand a warm love movie, several interrelated friends finally find their own warm love.
