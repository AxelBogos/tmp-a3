The American values reflected in this film can be ignored, and far-fetched plots can be ignored, for example, if there are only two injections in case, is it worth that much effort? There are also a few funny scenes, such as the dollars that keep popping up from ATM, and so on. I think this film actually focuses on the double-edged sword of artificial intelligence. Human beings always think that they can control everything, but once they are obsessed, they will lift a stone and drop it on their own feet.
