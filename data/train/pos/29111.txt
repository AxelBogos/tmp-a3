Recommend! The picture and the character of the characters are very good, and the actors felt a little affected at the beginning, but then it was natural, and the cooperation was also very good. At that time, the completion was quite good, the western tune with strong soundtrack, and I liked it very much, which was better than the ending that is everywhere now!
