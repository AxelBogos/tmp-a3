Can't help complaining about Violet, why listen to her attentively every time something happens? When there is still a chess game, people roar past with chicken feather blankets. The scene of Li Qiushui and Wu Xingyun singing and dancing and playing the piano together is simply beautiful. In the past, I didn't understand the love between the two women. I only knew that the scene was super beautiful. The actresses of that era were really beautiful in temperament!
