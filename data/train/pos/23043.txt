December 11, 2011 with Xiaobai in bishan. The color egg at the end is so wonderful that it laughs to death. The front is fine, better than valentine's day, but there is still a distance with love actually. Is zac really "swollen"? I saw Ingrid's previous film was star dust, so I can't adapt to this pair of young and old. I have too many stories. I like that unknown song with the same melody as everlasting friendship.
