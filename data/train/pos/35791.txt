Wonderful group portrayal, excellent screenplay arrangement. The close combination of movie time and real time is full of anxious atmosphere. The story of the expulsion of tyrants in ancient Greece is used as an analogy to the selfish faces of the townspeople. Gary Cooper kept the order and desperately became the emperor for the second time, stretching the shot composition from the actors' bevel upward to highlight the relationship between the guardian and the town.
