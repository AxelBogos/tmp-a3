Recently, how many people cry a lot when watching "three lives, three generations and Ten miles of Peach Blossom". In this context, I feel that with a score of 6.2, this film is seriously underestimated and supported by five stars. Within the prescribed time, tell the story clearly, the character is distinct, make you afraid, make you cry, let you burn, the rhythm is not messy, the plot basically justifies itself, that's enough.
