It can be said that Puyi is the most handsome emperor in history. Finally, it is said at the end that Puyi died in 1967, which is really good, and fate does not want him to admit his crime again. To put it another way, he is just an ordinary person. Finally, I like the soundtrack of this film very much. Thank the professor for writing such a good soundtrack!
