So gentle, think of a person with wings actually leaning on your shoulder to listen to your heart, they are willing to help you but unmoved-at least there is an angel worried for you, it is also a good thing. Only the eyes of children can feel the presence of angels, while adults struggle in their own world and have long forgotten the gaze of other eyes. The stacking of a large number of "heart voices" in the film, like somniloquy, presents a very charming poetic nature. When they felt the extremely gentle eyes of Ganz and Sandel on the big screen, they acted like angels with their eyes and eyebrows, and the charm of the screen came out. There are several fascinating things: the black and white tone is blessed with the photographer's grandmother's stockings, a unique filter; Wendes likes "the Sky above Berlin", and Wings of desire casually says, thanks to the Chinese translation of the name to get Berlin and the sky back; Gantz heard that Hitler had a stand-in, and then he played a Hitler; the most touching thing should be the end of the film paying tribute to angels such as Lao Ta Ozu.
