What is the origin of that ghost, controlling humans to imprison young women in order to feed themselves with their fears? What is the reason why it likes to use keys to make holes in people's bodies? Is it just to answer the name of "five keys"? The story can attract people to look down, but the front gimmick is too big, and the back ends carelessly, just like "the Martians haunt the earth". The singing extinguishes the Martians, and the throwing of a lamp makes the ghost go up in smoke.
