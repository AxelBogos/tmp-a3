Just after watching it, I thought it was a good shot. Of course, it could not be compared with the themes of several generations, such as "Family Spring and Autumn", but several characters with very characteristics were photographed within 2 hours. In particular, it describes the contradiction between father and son between the master and the third master and the feelings surrounding a woman. This is not a documentary. It's nice to talk about benevolence, righteousness and emotion with the background of Jin merchants.
