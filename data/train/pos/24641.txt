Bunuel's so-called innovation in this film does not lie in the signature surreal formalities, but in that he has written a stage play similar to Sartre's confinement. And the play is first of all about political metaphors. From the retreat of the servant to the trap of the master, the European-style aerial absurdity has melted into the magic sense of Latin America full of land flavor. The trapped scene of Woody Allen's Cairo Purple Rose character comes from this film. It's just, I'm not happy with the ending.
