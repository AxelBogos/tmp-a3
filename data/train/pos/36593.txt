What do I mean to you? Mike's only confession to Scott was terrible and desperate. Finally, Scott showed up in dapper clothes and looked at each other wordlessly at the funeral. Mike was back on the road in Idaho again. He said he had tasted the road all his life. Mike's meaning to Scott is just a cloud over Idaho that he has seen, experienced and eventually has to leave. Humble people, humble love, really sad.
