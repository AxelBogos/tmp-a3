It's very nice, recommended! The beautiful scenery of the Alps is not greasy, from childhood to a large handsome eagle, other animals, including antelope, fox, earth plucking mouse, snow rabbit, shot very clearly. Especially the animals fleeing under the avalanche and the eagle hunting large Milu deer, the scene is very shocking, which makes people sigh that the survival of animals in the natural environment is really a very difficult process. In the plot, the love and hate entanglement between the two eagles and their father and son is simple but natural. The soundtrack is very good, fitting in with the plot, adding enough emotion to the plot with few lines. At the end of the film, it was interesting to talk about the difficulty of shooting. I didn't expect that the eagle could be trained. Besides, Renault is still very handsome! I was moved by my father's change from paranoid blame to understanding.
