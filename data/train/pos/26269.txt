The contest between the two protagonists is a confrontation between men and men, soldiers and soldiers, so the part who is involved and wavering appears especially speculative and vulnerable in the process of fierce conflict between the two of them. and this strong contrast also greatly strengthens the male theme of the film. So to some extent, this film should become a classic that can not be missed in men's life.
