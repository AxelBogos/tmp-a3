Compared with other youth dramas, it is more like youth. There is no amazing appearance, no forced abortion, some nagging director hostel management, unified and ugly school uniforms, some throbbing youth and people who don't know where to go in the future. Unlike Director Gu, the episode of each paragraph is full of lost regrets, but the happy cup dance reunion appears in the dream.
