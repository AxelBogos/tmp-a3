Ashamed but excited, timid and brave; beautiful to tears from beginning to end, completely hit. Poems, songs, lights and thoughts that appear in the most secret dreams, empathic emotional patterns, and rigorous mathematical geniuses are not the most perfect results, but the best ones. Invasion, entanglement, evolution, liberation, is real growth. I think SJ's voice is sexier than ever. # Shanghai Film Festival #
