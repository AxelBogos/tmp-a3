Shakespeare's drama was put on the screen in the 1940s, and the processing of audio-visual technology did not lose the charm of the original work. The extremely intense style of drama, the poetic lines, the performance vocabulary between the two arts, the photography of push-pull and changeable techniques, and the scene scheduling with rich spatial expression, all of them have achieved its absolutely classic status of literary film. Lawrence Oliver is brilliant, has a deep accumulation of learning, and has a first-class performance of both writers and directors.
