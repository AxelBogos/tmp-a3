Originally, Takuya Kimura was invited to take the role of Ghana in 1995, but the film was delayed for three years for various reasons, and Kimura did not take part in the film because he missed the schedule. Oshima stressed that Kimura did not participate in the role is what he felt most regrettable. 1995 is the peak of Kimura Yan, although Longping is also good, but also want to see Kimura version of Ghana.
