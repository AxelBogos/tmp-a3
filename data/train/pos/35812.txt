This film is very good. It's divided into three sections. First, the US military attacks superficial positions. Second, tunnel operations. Three, fight back. The proportion of the third part is very low, and the second part is the main body. This part has been handled very well, showing both the hardship of the war and the spirit of revolutionary optimism.
