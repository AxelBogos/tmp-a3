Watching goose bumps was the weirdest horror movie I had ever seen during that time. I looked in the mirror with a wig and felt that I was afraid that two little girls who loved horror movies were scared into 🐶 horror movies or that Japan, South Korea and Thailand were better and the rest of the country was too bloody.
