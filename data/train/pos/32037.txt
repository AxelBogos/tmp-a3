Reliving the classics, I actually cried. Really beautiful, a tortuous relationship, a group of warm people. Yesenia's enthusiasm, frankness and determination have influenced at least a generation, but today I was moved by the kind Louisa, because of her, she finally achieved this pair of lovers, she is simple, kind, full of aura, I think if this story continues, she will certainly get good treatment in Europe and meet her true love MR.RIGHT.
People's feelings are like this, the bottom of the heart is the most real, empathy is empathy. What's more, I would like to thank the artists in the translation field for their achievements in this classic, teacher Li Zi's masterpiece, and the classic voice of that era, "soldier, you don't keep your word, you can't wait for me." When I was a child, I listened to the recording and editing countless times, and the charm of this voice is indescribable. Maybe today my work and my feelings are all affected by the story behind this voice. I really appreciate this beautiful memory. I hope she can pass it on. Don't lose your original mind. steadily move on, love you.
