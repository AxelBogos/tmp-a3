Starting at six o'clock in the evening, I ran over as soon as I got off work, and I saw Xiao Han while waiting. (leading the object) he must have seen the 03:30 show, when we were in mass logistics together, and the kid ran away with an excuse. He came to see a movie and despised him. Unexpectedly, the group-bought tickets of the unit have not been opened yet, fortunately, it is a half-price day, and it took 60 to buy two tickets. After watching it at nearly 8 o'clock, my wife almost lost her mobile phone. it was really a day of drama.
