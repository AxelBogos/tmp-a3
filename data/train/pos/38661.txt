It is true that the shooting at that time is more interesting, although the stunt makeup is not as good as it is now, but it is attractive, many successful original works are the products of that era, it is not that the modern film is not good enough, just can not find that feeling. After watching this, I always feel that there is something wrong with the remake of 2010. 2019 is deja vu, but it is important to use the 78 version of the heroine. Time is really a pig knife.
