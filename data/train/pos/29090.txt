The whole story shows the speed of China, giving people the impression that it is in a hurry, whether the shooting period is also in a hurry, and the location in Guangzhou is that the content of the story is very Chinese, but it has a bit of Hollywood meaning. The cast is good, and it is estimated that the running-in period is not proper enough and there are not many sparks. I still support Wu Shixian, three-and-a-half stars.
