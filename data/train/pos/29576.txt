Unlike BSG, the ST series is a relatively pure hard-core science fiction, as well as a nautical exploration story, with natural science fantasy as the story thread and theme. The tone was set from the first part, and the leading special effects at that time took up a lot of space, the description and exploration of unknown objects, the laying of the groundwork and the revelation of the truth were well arranged, the remote transmission was quite scary, and the origin of the prestige could be guessed in advance, but it was still shocking. 3.11
