I have to say that it is very convenient to make movies at home in South Korea. The plot is constantly pushed to the best part. It doesn't make sense if you don't cry. From time to time, the crying point is a mixture of warmth and a little laughter, which is a little bit closer to the rhythm of the heart. People are social and family animals living in this world. No matter what kind of movie it is, people will still be moved. And then there is the long shot in the film, which is really good at capturing characters and creating an environment.
