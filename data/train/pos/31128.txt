I didn't really like this movie until I saw it for the third time. All the necessary conditions are indispensable. I don't like books, I don't like the streets of Hong Kong, I don't like the culture of radio columns, and I don't like some wine when I don't like writing, so I probably can't understand the taste of this movie. It's good to think about it and watch it again this morning.
