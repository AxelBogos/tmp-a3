Although "Kids on the Street" is a comedy with too much artificial carving, in the face of a baby playing three stupid thieves like a god, the naive loveliness that originated from the child still inadvertently infected the audience. it makes people laugh enough, while the core of love and tenderness gives people enough cure again after laughter.
