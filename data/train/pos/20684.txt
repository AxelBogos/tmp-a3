Are you all crazy? Given such a low score for such a bold and wonderful film, I haven't seen such a wonderful Conan theatrical version for a long time. Leaving aside the ending part of a wave of anti-physical driving and daily football to save the world, as well as some bug as always, the plot is full of suspense, and the literary drama is more than the action drama. It can be said that the discussion and involvement of technology, justice, jurisprudence, judicial system, power and the fetters between people are really great. Some parts even make me think that this is a political metaphor film, and with this, M22 is already a high score in my heart.
