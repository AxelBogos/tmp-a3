UnderTaker, the most enduring forever! It's the most BIG of all the black deacons. Elizabeth still does not like it, although the opening and hanging is very handsome, the kind of cool BUT is very lack of reality, relatively speaking, the young master does not open the hang, only use a gun, it is very real, although often pretend B, but children's pretending can also be forgiven. In fact, I don't like young master and 384 very much, but the protagonists often don't like me, and generally like supporting roles in ashes.
