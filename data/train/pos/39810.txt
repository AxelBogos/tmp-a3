It's very beautiful! The storyline has long been familiar with the heart, but to see the confrontation between little Helen and Anne teacher is really wonderful, the two actors' play is wonderful, especially the physical performance and facial expression control. Teacher Anne did not treat Helen, who was deaf and blind, as a disabled person, but gave her the severity and punishment that normal people should have. A very respectable teacher, Helen finally only understood the corresponding relationship between some words and things. This step is very difficult and shocking.
