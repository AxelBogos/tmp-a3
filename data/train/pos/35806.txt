"sad Fairy Tales" was a good shot. It was so funny in the middle that I couldn't close my mouth, especially in the part of the Republic of China, where everyone worked very hard to play the period of the Republic of China. no, no, no. The ending is very sad, the hero finally got sick and died, but secret love is really a kind of happiness.
