I like Hou Mai's mean wisdom: to expose all superficial existence-self-esteem and loneliness, needs and worries, nobility and vulgarity, romance and lies, which are used to vaguely explain the so-called pursuit and richness of life. Just like the last random dance, no one is the director, only stupidity and greed make this group of people who indulge in hallucinations giggle and sigh.
