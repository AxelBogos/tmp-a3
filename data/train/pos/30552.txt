Personally, I only give a four points for this movie. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the scenes are too deliberate. The director wants to film the story of feelings and gratitude between little monsters and people. This kind of material is not a new development point, but in terms of this movie. I think to be emotional, feelings are not in place, comedy bar, some lines are not funny enough. The plot is not smooth. Painless, did not let people finish reading to find a feeling. It's all supported by stars.
