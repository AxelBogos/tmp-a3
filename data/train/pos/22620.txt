Like a happy martial arts movie. Kurt Russell grows a beard like Lin Zhengying. The sick, strong, dissolute and loyal Doc is the most dazzling, and his friendship with Wyatt is the most touching. "I have nothing left, no gift for you, no honor, no dignity, no money. I don't even know how to make a living, but I swear I will always love you." After the life and death test of a hail of bullets, Wyatt's love confession is simple and sincere.
