These five stars are for the first hour. When I saw the name, I thought it was a war movie, but then I found out it was a crime movie. I cheered for both the story and the shooting until the first hour and 46 seconds. As a result, the monster appeared in 1 hour and 47 seconds. And then I got into a fight with vampires. As a result, I couldn't help it and fast-forward in more than 40 minutes.
