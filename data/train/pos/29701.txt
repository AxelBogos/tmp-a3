After watching it very quietly, it is the kind of pure and clean movie about the persistence of their respective love. The old lady used elegant acting skills to express restraint and secret surge, how we will grow old, and those we love, let us rethink the intimate relationship between partners, as well as the relationship between marriage and love. The last ten minutes of the film are full of tension, and the last shot is full of meaning and endless aftertaste.
