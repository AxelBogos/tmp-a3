At first I didn't understand why pigs were the smartest and let them be rulers, but later I found it ironic. A pig is a pig, and the nature of being gluttonous and lazy will not change. The rules seem to be for rulers, and they proclaim that all animals are equal. However, for the sake of profit, the rulers made friends with the "bad guys" they hated, and they began to crack down on the lower animals and began to crush and kill within the so-called equal manor. Another bloody revolution has begun. When a man is enslaved, tens of thousands of people will stand up. In the class system, equality may never exist, but the spirit of pursuing freedom and equality will last forever.
