Watching this movie is like watching a bygone era. The Soviet Union in 1974 was the most brilliant Soviet Union, and it was also the Soviet Union approaching its decline. This film is like a scenery film that takes me around the Soviet Union. The heroine is very beautiful and has a slight exposure. Some places are still very funny.
