It hurts to see the picture story and face with ðŸ˜Œ. When Chengmin went through 16 years alone and returned to the normal world, he found that no one believed that he was Chengmin, and he had no place to live. Fear, fragility and sadness mingled with Chengmin. Jiang Dongyuan's tearful eyes are too hurt to hide his face. I like the story very much. I think it's better than "your name". The idea and idea of a special fixed time is super beautiful, and the big perspective tone is also too beautiful.
