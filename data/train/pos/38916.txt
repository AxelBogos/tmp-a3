What a shock! In the inner part of the explosion, I said about ten OMG in succession, and it really felt like watching a live rocket launch failed. Although it was a science fiction film, it was extremely realistic. The new alien concept and Jodie acting skills were amazing. Is there a god who told me that the setting of 18 hours of video makes sense. Once again, I feel the depth of religious status in the hearts of Americans.
