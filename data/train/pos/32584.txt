Gu long's classic detective martial arts film is not as complicated as the third young master, but it is also very good. I like the last paragraph best, long Xiaoyun flies a knife to Xiao Li, ruthlessly affectionate to Xiao Li, and still wants the empty-handed Li Xunhuan to pick up the sword and fight with him again, which is quite a bit of a thief and a gentleman's struggle. Love triumphs over ruthlessness, because of the way of heaven. Five poison boys will poison 365 stunts, an average of one a day, really not afraid of thieves to think of thieves, how can not make people frightened.
