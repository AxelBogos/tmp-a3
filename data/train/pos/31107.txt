# BJIFF# finally wants to admit that Bergman is a movie master. The first two films, "Virgin Fountain" and "still in the Mirror", don't feel so good. It is good to use vision to present the dream, reality and dream intertwined narrative, reality one day, dream life. Uncover the flaws of his life in a dream, examine repentance, but can do nothing about it because of his impending old age, just like a watch without hands that cannot turn back time.
