Those who like Peng Yuyan will certainly like him very much, making him so handsome. Jiang Wen, who is still so fond of playing, many of the connotations mentioned are quite to my taste, but to tell you the truth, I saw some of the individual parts an hour ago. In addition, I have to say that this action director is very good. Some details can still be seen in the "devils are coming" Jiang Wen, but I believe this is not the best level of Jiang Wen now. PS: Zhou Yun really likes to watch.
