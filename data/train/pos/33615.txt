An overseas Chinese director can film the story of educated youth so well that distance produces beauty. The magical combination of Zhou Xun, Liu Ye and Chen Kun left their best time in this movie. Liu Ye and Chen Kun's love for the little tailor is two states of love, one is outward, one is introverted, one is passionate, and the other is long-term love. The little tailor understood the beauty of the outside world and chose desire and freedom.
