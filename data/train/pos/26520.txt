The technique of expression and the colored eggs of jump's other works are quite surprising, and some original small details can also reflect the intentions of the film director. Although there are regrets and slightly idealized places, I can still praise this film without hesitation as a positive textbook for compressing and cutting the plot of the film. In any case, doesn't this also interpret the purpose of "friendship, hard work and victory"?
