As the representative work of Xie Fei, the fourth-generation academic director, this film has a high degree of completion. At that time, Xie Fei was the only one who still maintained a very high level of artistic creation among the fourth generation of directors. This film shows the anti-dramatic tendency of a group of academic directors in film creation: consciously abandon the narrative techniques with dramatic conflicts as the core, weaken the story of the film and pursue more portrayal of the environment and the psychological state of the characters.
