"omnipotence" is just like the title of the film, the hero can do anything when he hangs up. In the face of social injustice and small potatoes coming forward, the whole city of India is facing unprecedented challenges. Fortunately, the Blind Man is acting on behalf of heaven. If the role is set by the villain, I am afraid the immortals will not be able to save the city. So less evil, more virtue and good deeds is the right way of life.
