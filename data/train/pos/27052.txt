For Chen Musheng, who makes fewer costume martial arts dramas, the overall performance has been quite good. The presentation of the film in the form of chapters basically restores the form and content of the original novel, and for other aspects of the film, I believe Tsui Hark, as a producer and screenwriter, must have given a lot of help. In the film, Anita Mui's appearance is really heroic, while Guan Zhilin is slightly inferior. Zhang Tielin is more attractive as a villain.
