This film really made me find that Leonardo was just untalented. After Matthew McConaughey's ten minutes, Jonah Hill was even more malleable than him. The scene that got high could have been turned into an one-man show, but all I saw was a fool in the convex shape. If McConaughey plays the leading role, it feels like the whole can be raised to a higher level. Everything went well after Martin won the prize.
