The real pain that eclipses all cruel youth, the genius debut that no boast words can match. The clues behind the layer-by-layer infiltration and shocking results are not only involved in the extreme unease of the motion images, but also hidden in the accumulation of repression after the calm pace of life. All this is even more valuable under the daily interpretation that neither the director nor the lead actor deliberately emphasizes the shocking theme-- unhurried and clinging to the context, exquisitely narrates the two major issues of shame and identity of general human anxiety from a special perspective.
