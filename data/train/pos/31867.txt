This kind of plot is completely mentally retarded to death ~ if it wasn't for the happy happy ending finale ~ this movie can't even rank for 0 points, the hero is so fleshy, why do you want to be a bottom? And why does the hero want to be with the uncle? Is it the so-called one-off booking for life? PS: the poster has nothing to do with the content! I thought it was a wild western cowboy movie in the background.
