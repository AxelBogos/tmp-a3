Sorentino is comparable to Li he in the expressive force of the camera, just as du Mu said that whales suck ao throw, cattle ghosts and snake gods, which is not enough to create fantasy for it. Seeking revenge for his father is the most focused on the narrative, but it is still in the form of prose, like the children who play table tennis in the film, so it is right to give up the narrative and turn to Fellini. Even so, this film is still interesting and enjoyable.
