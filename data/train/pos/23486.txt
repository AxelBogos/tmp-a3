There are bright spots in reasoning (for example, boss cleverly uses the personal characteristics of the victim Li Liang to set up a game), and there are also problems (for example, Li Dakang went to the cinema to learn that Fang's place of detention was not derived from the chain of clues obtained by active investigation, that is, hard setting), audiovisual everywhere gives people a good feeling, worthy of second brush to study. At that time, the wife character was not always clamoring for her husband to come back to take care of his family (I was talking about you, the behind-the-scenes player), nor would he wear naked clothes on his thighs (the god of medicine was talking about you), but even criticized Lu Yi, who once slipped into cynicism and self-preservation. Good woman!
