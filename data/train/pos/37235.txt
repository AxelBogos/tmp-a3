In Jackie Chan's movie 12 years ago, it seems that except for the actors' costumes, some of the plots are a little childish, and most of them are good. It is still the usual routine of Jackie Chan movies: small potatoes who know a little kung fu are suddenly involved in a big storm and come to a foreign country to pursue clues. In order to save beautiful women, they have to do everything they can to go through a hail of bullets. In the end, the just side wins, and the small potatoes become big heroes, but the budding love is lost in a sense of regret.
