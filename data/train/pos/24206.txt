Park Tsan-wook continues his black wind, bringing a scene of mournful love of oriental vampires. Despite the darkness and cruelty.
Like the director's handling and editing of the scene. Bright dazzling houses, dark, repressed streets. The scene when the man picked up the woman and put it in his shoes was very warm and the beginning of evil fate. And at the end, I will focus on this pair of shoes, and everything will be gone.
