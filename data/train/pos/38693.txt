The plot is simply silly, and it is too anti-intellectual to use ghosts to educate minors, which is not only of no educational significance but may be counterproductive. It is better to tell the inspirational story of smashing Sima vats. Of course, people are just a ghost movie, and they don't intend to educate anyone, but what's even more unbearable is that the evil spirits are already trapped. Why do you want my male god to die? It's anti-human!
