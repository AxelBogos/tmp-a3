"good things are always fleeting, and memory is based on experience, so it inevitably loses its original color. perhaps the greatest sorrow in life is not that you can't see the beautiful things, but that you can no longer stand the unbeautiful things after seeing them. when you meet someone or something, you have foreseen the pain of separation, so you must be in love with something."
