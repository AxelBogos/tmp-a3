I was very excited to see it, because everyone could die at any time except the protagonist. I thought the beautiful woman Matthew liked was a liar, but she was a good girl. Matthew still can't get rid of Chandler's shadow, just like Monica. Or should the performance feel different, they all act as they are, why do they need actors?
