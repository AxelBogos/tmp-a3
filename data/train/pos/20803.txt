70th Anniversary Film Festival * Tianshan. 3.5ax 5, Huang Jianxin focuses not so much on self-replication as on the authenticity of Philip K Dick (the mirror image in the film has no so-called reproduction in Borges), and the relationship between real people and robots is more of a power relationship, similar to patriarchy (to be disciplined) but more instrumental (based on the exchange of interests) and more racial (substitution crisis). The plot of the film is flying away, and it is somewhat immature to use the cartoon-style "ready to go" to continue the conflict, but its shape (abstract indoor setting, red and blue contrast lighting, sculpture, models and other humanoid symbols) takes away the breath of real China, but is full of avant-garde structural sense. You can't even see where it was shot (even driving is the right rudder! ), it is this strange visual experience that reminds me of the nightmare of full recall-the whole experience may be fake. The film follows the "Black Cannon incident". Zhao Shuxin doesn't play chess, and the cinema laughs, and the mocking Wenshan Huihai in this film is the quintessence of Chinese zz. You see, this is the fun of the 1980s. Go ahead and look back.
