The original work as the founder of Blizzard Villa, its own bug can not be used as a reason to criticize the plot of this film. On the contrary, this edition is almost the best adaptation so far. The original work is an abrupt stop of contemplation and fear, and this play is a long-lasting retribution of cause and effect. The actors, photography and soundtrack are impeccable, and the moment the truth is revealed, it makes the story more like an internal closed circle, sealing all the sins of human nature here.
