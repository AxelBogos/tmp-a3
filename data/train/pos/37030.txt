It's really pretty. No matter the lines, rhythm, costume, adaptation, acting skills, appearance, there is nothing to find fault with, it is comfortable to see the whole journey. It's just a play at best. It's not like Xu Haofeng, is it so picky? It's fine if you get it. Really do not know what Douban score want to drop? In addition, the shooting sculpture is obviously not as good-looking as this one, why does it have 8 points?
