It's as if you can't see the whole world through the camera.
I can say I love you so easily under the dark curtain. Until the end of the world.
But out of a small grid, we are stuck in the situation where our lovers are not satisfied.

In the end, I was the only one who left.
Turn into a rainbow in your tears forever.

OST is awesome. So I gave the fifth star.
