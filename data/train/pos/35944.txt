We reward the most superficial, the stupidest, the meanest and the loudest. We no longer know what is decent, shameless, right or wrong, and the worst people are both famous and respected. Lying and walking fear are acceptable, as long as it makes money. We have become a nation of hate traffickers shouting slogans and spewing anger. We lost our goodwill, we lost our souls.
