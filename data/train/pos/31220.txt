The white clothes dried on the balcony fluttered with the wind, rode bicycles slowly through the ramps, and the city was fresh in the summer sun. There is a fantastic place on the top of the mountain, the beginning of a dream, and where the heart goes. This animation may not be the first, but it is engraved in my bones with deep marks. Walking on the streets of Japan, looking for it, looking for this feeling. The shadow under the green tree, the laughter of my parents and sisters in the room. It turns out I've always had it.
