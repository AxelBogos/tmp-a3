Come on, let me think about how much I still remember-Uncle Takeshi Kitano had an ill-fated movie, but the scenery in the wild was so beautiful that it was intoxicating. Van Sant's hero walked into the screen and kissed the heroine. I don't know how to shoot it. Forget whose "porn movie", wow ha ha, is really a whimsical drama. In addition, a man hammered the nouveau riche old man beside him with a hammer in the cinema. The blood spattered everywhere, the people around him were stunned, and then he continued to watch the movie. And Zhang Yimou's is actually pretty good. Several subtitles of Wong Kar-wai are better than movies. Hou Xiaoxian filmed a scene at the gate of the cinema, which was very insipid and very much like an old memory with a little dust. Chen Kaige took it. I completely forgot.
