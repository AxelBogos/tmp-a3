I remember crying when I was watching the movie. I was laughed at by my sister next to me all the time. What an annoying feeling! Then, decisively drive my sister out of the room so that I can enjoy this great only Chinese film that won the Palme d'Or award more seriously! -- talking about a lifetime! A year, a month, a day, an hour, is not a lifetime! -I'm a fake bully, and you're the real Yu Ji! There is no distinction between human drama and drama. -from one to the end.
