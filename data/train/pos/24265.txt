The film is actually a bit homosexual. I didn't realize that Diana Krueger was already a common face in French movies before watching it, and the new actress LEA will soon win the Palme d'Or in Cannes. However, as a historical film, the film revolves around the legend of Queen Mary. Although the plot is absurd, it is still a little new.
