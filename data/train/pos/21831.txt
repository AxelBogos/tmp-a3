A good film of the fighting nation that is very appreciative. Pros: as much as the battle scenes in Hollywood, Russian pure men make people excited. Bazookas and tanks fight in turn, and the fierce sense of substitution in street warfare is extremely strong. In the full version, the beautiful border scenery before the war and the people on the bus are very loving. The disadvantage is that the little boy's dreams occasionally put people into play.
