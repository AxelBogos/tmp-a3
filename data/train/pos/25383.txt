You have taught me to understand that the tenderness of others is the power to transcend everything. I let you understand that being strong and brave is the strength to face the future. I haven't seen you for such a long time, you are still so gentle, but I didn't expect you to be so strong. Since you can send me away bravely without regret, then I do not look back and move forward without words is to respond to your tender and best respect.
