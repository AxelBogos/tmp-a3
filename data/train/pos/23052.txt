The most ferocious serial killer caught in Soviet history was arrested at a time when the regime changed and was almost pardoned by Yeltsin. The atmosphere of the HBO scene is excellent. If it hadn't been for Bao Xiaoqiang's father and three-eyed Ravens, listening to strange English all the time, I would have thought it was a dubbing Soviet film.
