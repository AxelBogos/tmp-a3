I don't understand why Sing Yeh got such a low score in a serious action movie, maybe it's because you're used to his comedy that he looks creepy and acts as a hero, or maybe it's because of the plot, but I think Sing Yeh must have wanted to be a hero all the time, or he would have been a comedian as soon as he made his debut.
