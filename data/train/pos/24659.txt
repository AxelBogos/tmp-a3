The team of Renyi + Mandarin, to put it bluntly, moved the acting skills of everyone on the stage to the big screen, and it was very enjoyable. As a mentally handicapped fan of he Bing, I am a little sorry because his role is too upright, but teacher Han Tongsheng's acting skills burst again. As soon as he opened his mouth, I wanted to get down on my knees. It is a pity that Mi Tiezeng is a little out of standard and exerts too much effort. Anyway, it's worth seeing!
