The biggest success of this film is that the car is photographed as a snake-like creature, feeling that the car is not a simple mechanical object, but an animal with aura and life. The best part shows this best in the parking lot. PS, complain about @ Huang Qiusheng how to die as soon as he plays a policeman. @ Yu Wencheng is so silly and cute, which is better than @ Big S's stiff face.
