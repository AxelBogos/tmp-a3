Movie is about 3 points, because I love woody allen and a wonderful moment, so I still give 4 points.
Just acting skills, just such old-fashioned affection, still spread his love and love for the world to me, the same feeling.
He thinks that he may be getting older and unable to keep up with the times, but that's what he wants to feel. It's not good. Anyway, everyone doesn't have to keep up with the times.
