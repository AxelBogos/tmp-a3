I've seen it at least three times. The theme song will be fine and hum a few words. Yeoh Ziqiong as my favorite martial arts action actress, it can be said that although only a theme song, but also left an indelible color. The martial arts movies of the 1990s grew up with me, and now they still look so warm. The moves in the play are so wonderful, the characters are so beautiful, so young, so are we when they are old, but I think it is the love of martial arts when they are not old.
