The growth record of ordinary young people. It doesn't resonate much, but it still looks good. The protagonist is probably like most American teenagers, neither handsome nor ugly, not particularly rebellious nor particularly excellent, doing what should be done at the right age, the growth experience is mediocre, and the film is calm, but you can feel the director's sharpness and ingenuity, light, but can aftertaste for a long time.
