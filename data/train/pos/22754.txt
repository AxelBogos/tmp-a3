If it wasn't for Stephen Chow, this movie would be just one of Wang Jing's bad films! A comedian, whether he is a gag or a prude, the audience wants to laugh at the first sight of him, which is the greatest affirmation of his career for the comedian! Just me, if you choose the third of the actors who meet the above conditions, first Zhou Xingchi, then Ge You, and then Huang Bo!
