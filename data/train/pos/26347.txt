The story is good, and the way of telling it is also good, with texture and directing style, but the way that the new generation of Chinese directors use few lines and use silence instead of the plot really makes people feel pretentious. Fortunately, the film cutting ability of director Cheng er is good, coupled with the performance of several good actors, so that the film has its own flavor, but not reduced to a bad film. In addition, the soundtrack is also good and bad, which makes the film lose face and add color. At the beginning, the soundtrack was too much and messy.
