The educational meaning is to use the thinking of "suddenly leave you, and then your sadness shows how much you love me" to solve the problem. The result may be "never come back" or "never come out again". Belem is lovely but not very rational. She finds that the problem is first of all a threat, then refuses to communicate, and finally plays a big game. Later, it was not easy for her to see her boyfriend sad. Of course, it was even more difficult for her to see her boyfriend happy.
