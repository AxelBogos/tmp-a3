As soon as I finished, I was bored when I watched the film review. Did I really understand this role when I said that there was something wrong with Zhu Zhixun's acting skills? Jiang Taiwu's role, the profiler could not come to a conclusion, and the lie detector could not help him. In essence, he was a psychopath, a born performing personality with strong psychological quality. So I feel that his performance is completely in line with the role, especially when Officer Kim exposed the killing of his father, the pupil instantly dilated, really unique! It's also hard to understand why the score is so low, it's worth more than 7.5.
