I still remember watching "alive" a long time ago, and books and movies were very moving. At that time, I thought I could read another literary work related to the Cultural Revolution, but I didn't look into it, because I always thought it would be banned. And this film really profoundly describes the humiliation of various classes at that time. Thinking about how many literary works were lost at that time, as a new generation who did not worship Chairman Mao so blindly, his vision may be more critical, and the older generation really worshipped blindly.
