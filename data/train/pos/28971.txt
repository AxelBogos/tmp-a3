I am a spy of God, and the more innocent I am, the more evil I am. I have never seen such a lovely thief turn into a homicidal maniac. The front shot is too good, that is, his unquestionable identification with his self-identity at a young age is particularly surprising, and that sense of freedom is too charming. This devil-hearted angel makes me doubt. Is it really good for the movie to make the murderer artistic? fortunately, the last part of the film is finally flat, which makes me rational again. Maybe it's just because he's really just a kid, and there's really nothing to dig inside him.
