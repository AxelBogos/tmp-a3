Homosexuality, father-son relationship, stress coping, even what is fair. Danny to Cater is the kind of "I love you have nothing to do with you" love, "I love you no matter what you say, I love you do not care whether you love me back or not." At the end, C asked D to leave him, D sadly said, "Henry hurt me far less than you hurt me" and D's performance in class after hearing the bad news of C's death was enough to burst into tears on the spot. D's mother is very forgiving.
