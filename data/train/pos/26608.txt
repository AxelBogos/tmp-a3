Add one star of praise! The plot rhythm is very good and complete, the three-line parallel open ending and Taiwan elements are interesting, but the short board of special effects is particularly obvious. This film again discusses that the sex of abortion is too overloaded, so the anti-routine role of Tiger Yeh is not only well covered, but also good-looking and bright!
