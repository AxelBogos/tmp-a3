It's good-looking, plus performance and photography. Oscar's psychological description is not very clear; except for the suppression of sexual orientation caused by the shadow of childhood, other personality descriptions are more vague-the director's expression of the emotional state is stronger than the portrayal of the full character (which is also the highlight of acting and photography) the hamster's conversation is humorous and brings out lonely sadness. No matter how cruel youth is, it is much easier for Western comrades than we are.
