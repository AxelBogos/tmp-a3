A movie about a movie. Sometimes a movie is not about promoting certain ideas or arousing some resonance, it is just a movie. It meets the needs of all moviegoers: curiosity, paranoia, fantasy, virtual, and laugh, anger, and tremble. This is a movie that belongs to Quentin, nothing else, no genres, no tricks (it can only be said that Quentin used the techniques he most wanted to use). It's just that the only flaw in shaping the characters is that it's perfect.
