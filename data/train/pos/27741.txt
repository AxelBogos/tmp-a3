The narrative is concise and round, and several commonly used elements are scattered, which makes the film quite enjoyable, the quality of the music is still good, and sometimes inadvertently humorous or sarcastic. In the film, the seemingly impersonal people are full of warmth, and the sullen guys are very warm inside, looking at the issue of immigration in a different state of mind. Aki in his sixties has some ideas, and he is lovely and beautiful. Watching the film will remind people of another Aki's Le Havre.
