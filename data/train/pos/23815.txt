The world seen in the film is like a sheepdog (police) protecting lambs (citizens) from wolves (criminals). Or they are framing their own image of the police chief: it is both traditional and humane, hoping that it may be something that will last forever, but it will also make people recognize my face. The last image plan submitted to them was naive.
