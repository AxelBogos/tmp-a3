In addition to several popular pop songs selected for the audience, the whole concert concept is complete and advanced, the music selection arrangement is like the sound of nature, and the stage presents exquisite temperament. The singing is very different from the most wonderful singing of 94mur95 and 98Muth99. In addition to the reasons for long retirement, I am afraid there is also a change in the concept of music (see the dust at the beginning and the lyrics at the end of the dream). Faye Wong and her concert (like many previous shows) will certainly become a cultural symbol and musical milestone of the times, whether she deliberately or not. I love it so much!
