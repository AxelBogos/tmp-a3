Today, when I saw the photos of friends in Guilin playing in their hometown and the statues of third Sister Liu and Brother A Niu, I suddenly felt the impulse to re-watch this old movie. I can't remember when I saw it for the first time, but now I see it again with this nostalgia, but it is a different flavor, whether it is beautiful hometown water, this homesickness is both beautiful and sad. . Guilin, my dear hometown, have you ever known how much I miss you?
