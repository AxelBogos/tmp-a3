The last masterpiece of tvb, star-studded. The length of the show is a bit worrying, but the overall standard is still good. Among the protagonists, Cai Shaofen's acting skills are the most outstanding, but Li Zi's beauty is also hard to look away. Zhong Jiaxin's performance was a pleasant surprise, while Chen Baozhu's temperament was heartbreaking. It is the habit of watching TVB to learn about the life experiences of the actors while watching the play. I always feel that the actors and roles set off each other as if they are more wonderful.
