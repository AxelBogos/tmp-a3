Bong Junhao is a real geek. At first I thought it was a satirical comedy under the cloak of horror, but I couldn't laugh with a smile. Forced into a desperate situation, the lone hero rode alone for thousands of miles to save his relatives, broke through many difficulties, and finally caught the monster of the Han River and launched it fiercely. A sip of phlegm. And threw up on his shoes. The fate of small potatoes in the big background is both tragic and sarcastic. He held his turbid breath for too long until the hero bladed the monster and spit it out.
