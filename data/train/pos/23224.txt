People do not have a choice, there is no pain, although this film has a very extreme creativity, but the viewer can completely ignore the criticism of creativity, into the scene to think, from this point of view, the film is successful, in fact, the writer and director have not completely mastered the film, this film has the same classic potential as inception, a bit of a pity! You need to calm down and think about it for a while after the movie is over.
