Sunny afternoons, busy days and nights
We weave carefully, she is our princess.
I seem to see your smile and cry
Don't be sad. This is your home.
It's like every child leaves his parents.
We've lost her, and we'll never have another one to replace her.
We saw her off by the river
Can you see that jewel, it is the tears that we miss you
Rest in peace, my child.
Rest assured, our princess.
