2019siff | 8.5. Think of Rilke's saying, "Beauty is not what, but the beginning of horror that we can just bear." Lulu is so beautiful, so beautiful that people are thrilling. The world loves her, she is pure and seductive fresh desire, eyebrows and smiles are full of naive amorous feelings, like a mirror reflecting everyone's lust and desire; however, beauty is always so frightening that it makes Shane feel that "marrying her is equivalent to suicide" and finally becomes the victim of human evil and primitive desire in the faint flicker of Christmas candlelight. Jack the Ripper walked silently into the fog, behind which was the weeping Alva. Pandora's magic box was opened, and everyone who was tempted to pay suffered misfortune, but what was wrong with beauty itself.
