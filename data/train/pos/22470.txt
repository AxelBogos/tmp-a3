Of the three films, this one is the funniest, with everything you should have, especially the fight. I had a good time. Colin's good in this film is too unreal. I hope this unreality can successfully awaken the girl who is intoxicated with it. If you are fat, bad-mouthed and always in trouble, please believe that it is really impossible for you to find a boyfriend. Even if you are lucky enough to meet a blind man, he will abandon you after seeing who you really are, believe me.
