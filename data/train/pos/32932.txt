"in the future, there will be no trouble in the future." I was very honored to participate in the pre-release exchange of the producer "Fujita", from which I also learned about the opportunity and process of making this film. Music and television often appear in the movie, and this one is even more closely related to it. I especially like the last part of the movie. On the whole, the story is funny, funny, warm and beautiful. In terms of dubbing, Hoshino and Blackwood match well, but when I was a child, I was a little out of tune. Dad is the beautified version of Hosoda. 2019.4.14
