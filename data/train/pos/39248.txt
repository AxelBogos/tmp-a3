A pretty good movie recently, when I watched so many movies fast forward, my roommate asked me why I didn't fast forward ~ the rhythm was quite good, the plot was satisfactory, and the most important thing was that the fight scene was amazing ~ because the dubbing was in English, so the whole style was quite good. If it's Japanese, uh-huh, it must be pretty weird ~ it's worth watching more times.
