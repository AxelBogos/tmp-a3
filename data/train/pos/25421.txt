I am sometimes a little paranoid about the kind of love film that I have been through all my life. I also believe that they will experience a unique trust and live a peaceful life with their tacit understanding, so that they can rely on each other when they grow old. But who would have thought that senile dementia would be so fooled by fate that there was more of that play in old age, but it was no longer a lifetime of loyalty that could easily say everything. Don't cheat as much as possible, don't give up on that person, this is the basic definition
