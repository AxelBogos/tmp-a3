Who says American children don't have to go to school and can grow up at will? Those who are outside the system are freaks everywhere. But the difference is the soil, freaks find the right growth direction, can still be accepted by the system. No matter how complicated the spiritual world of senior high school students is, they cannot escape the age limit. Face life, face reality, never accept without confrontation, take a step back and find your true self. In fact, this is really an inspirational film!
