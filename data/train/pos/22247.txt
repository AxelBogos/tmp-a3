2017 065 second brush. I just watched the first episode of the Flash this morning. Compared with Star-Lord, the experiences of heroes when they were young were always so similar; Star-Lord and Gamora gave me a feeling of supreme treasure and Bai Jingjing, with the same appearance and makeup; Marvel's new rule: it's not a character-driven story, it's a prop-driven story. I don't think anyone reacted to Stan Lee and Kevin Bacon in that game. I am Groot.
