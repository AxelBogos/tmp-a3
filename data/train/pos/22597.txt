The old man's growing-up movie is like the result of Rushmore cutting off the teenage line. Compared to geniuses or Darjeeling, the film emphasizes individual transformation rather than family reconciliation. After all, the son dies easily, as if it were just a tool for the father to know himself (+ financier). This kind of film is like a placebo, telling you that it's not shameful to be a man-child, and you still have a chance to grow up.
