The overall performance is good, very old Beijing flavor, Li Yifeng and Feng Xiaogang father-to-son play let me feel deeply. And I don't think it's appropriate for Wu Yifan with thin arms and legs. The expression of the whole movie hasn't changed much, which is a big failure in the film. Xu Qing's chatterbox is more authentic than a Beijing girl.
