Song: willing to replace you. Mp3
Singer: Zheng Yijian album: anti-town Takashi Studio

Willing to replace you.

No matter how the wind blows
Just want Yiyi to look at you.
Can you still hope in the stillness of the night
Can withstand good injury and sorrow
Just because I have you in my heart
The memory of Lu Yao's long night never gives up.
The figure of the long street is proud through the wind and rain.
Once ran away together, not afraid to break into the Jedi.
Like a dream like smoke
All-like game
It's as if heaven and earth are picking
