Instead of a gun, Uncle Ki took a briefcase instead! I have to say, the fat Reeves is very suitable for the role of the lawyer, very good film, very attentive director, great editing, coupled with Uncle Ki's mature acting skills, but not many people have seen it. It is also two reversals, convincing! The killer only surfaced at the last minute, some accident, the truth was broken and scattered in the whole film, ingenious use of flashback makes people feel natural at last, good film!
