Just watching the movie, trying to describe the cruelty of war, heavy reality, life as light as dirt, emotion as thin as dust, tough no mercy, no love and human relations entanglement to please the audience. Julie is really arrogant, she is strong and unhesitant, saying that her beauty may not be the best praise for her, beauty is just a bottleneck for Julie, I appreciate such a woman very much!
