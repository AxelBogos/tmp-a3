Ruffian Kun finally recommended a reliable crime film with heavy tastes. although the movement and soundtrack of the seats are not as high as Park Zanyu, the script is much better than many simple-style movies. The theme almost became a prisoner, and when the devil was always in suspense, various heavy-flavored abuse methods tormented the audience's compassion, and the final reversal of the story was clever, an unexpected dark fairy tale. ★★★★
