It's a pity that I didn't watch this movie when I was young, and now I still lack childlike innocence. There are many troughs in this film due to the limitations of the times, such as the set looks very fake, the lion laughs when he comes out, and the witch solves it with a pool of water. But the film's beautiful songs, good special effects and actors' hard-working performance also make the film a classic. Judy Garland showed great talent from an early age.
