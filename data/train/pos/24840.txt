Waste firewood level plot! Masters Jump Scare! Ah, I finally lost my sleep at midnight on January 14th. (why didn't anyone howl about the scariest place-- a man was awake in the middle of the night while his bed was moving, rummaging through cabinets and looking under the bed with nothing (pause). Below, a monster that looks like Pale Man squinted and stared at him, his body still folded. I watched the monster standing by his bed and staring at him. I thought it would be nice if the monster stood behind him and watched the video. I got what I wanted.
