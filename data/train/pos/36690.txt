The second time (09-10-02): revisit 1 and 2 in order to see 3. I watched it with LP. We couldn't help being moved by the team friendship of the little guys. But at the end of the film, it was a little pity that Noah's ark did not come in handy at the end of the film when the little squirrel chiseled the glacier and suddenly receded the flood.
