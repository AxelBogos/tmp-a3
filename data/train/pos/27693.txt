How can I put it? four stars to the actors? it's a strange movie in which the actors' smooth acting skills are all destroyed by the inexplicable plot, and the suspense layers are all tangled up like headphone wires in the end. What a pity. Wu Zhenyu and Zhou Xun have a good sense of CP, and they play with a lot of details. It's remarkable. Teacher Zu's acting skills, not to mention, are naturally in-depth. It's just that the stylist hates a little bit.
