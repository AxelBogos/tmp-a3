A very good female-themed literary film, because I like Penelope in "Midnight Barcelona", only after watching this film did I pay attention to the director Amodova, who is known as the "Master of desire". His film uses bright and bold colors, and is especially good at depicting the subtle psychology of women. For a time, I suspected that this film was a female director's work, and later found on the Internet that Amodova was a GUY. No wonder!
