The film starts with a small cut on "family planning", which is smaller than the expected historical pattern, but the fate and emotions of the characters are still full and moved. Haiyan's role is the most tearful, such a role is often the most resentful, but here to get the greatest sympathy, decades of guilt and self-remorse, to death has not been completely relieved â€¦ Those childhood clips in the 1980s are memories of personal experience, bringing a strong feeling. The brothers' brothers and their love and hatred, the scars and suffocations of the two families have all turned into a wisp of smoke in the long river of history, and there is no need to pursue the past.
