It's not bad, duck. After reading it, I want to brush it twice. Watch the short film of more than 30 minutes before. When I went out of the subtitle, I looked at the time code and found that it was still early. Thought it was really a full-shot movie without downtime. As a result, the subtitles add up to be the drama in the play. To tell you the truth, the victory lies in the plot. Others, including the second half of the dialogue, are very common. After watching it, I feel like watching an ordinary Japanese drama. The supporting roles are also quite promising, especially the eldest sister of Party A, which is so funny. Recommend it. Pretty funny.
