Ha, the German colonel is the most interesting. They call me Earhart from the concentration camp! This is one of the best World War II movies! Witty and witty, it not only makes people feel the tension brought about by the clouds of war and the shadow of Nazi death, but also defuses it four or two times. When he was in the enemy camp, he still did not forget that the husband and wife were jealous and made fun of the Nazis. Using Shakespeare's lines is not only absurd, but also makes people seriously and truly experience the great sadness caused by the war.
