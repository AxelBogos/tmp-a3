The whole film likes the long shot of Ji Ma going to the mayor in the middle of the night, the block is backward, the pace is forward, the heart is firm, and the push is smooth. It is the only warm moment in this gloomy, cold, cold, corrupt and violent story of upper-level corruption and lower-level theft. At that moment, Jima seemed to have the halo of the protagonist in the Izaka Kotaro story, wayward and duty-bound to confront the whole system. Unfortunately, fairy tales are always beautiful and reality is always sad.
