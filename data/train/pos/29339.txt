Leave your name in archaeology! I feel that this film has been underestimated by Douban. The acting skills of everyone in the orz play is remarkable. Zhao Yan and A Lei are both adolescent children with little pinch, ha, one is a cute girl who regards herself as a little queen, and the other is a super cute teenager 😏 who loves to overexert herself in front of the goddess in the rebellious period. Liu Yifei and Chen Bolin really performed this sense of youth!
