July seems to be very good, but it is the person who broke the glass. She lives a different self in her heart, but she is actually more self-centered. Ansheng looks like a wild child, but he attaches the most importance to affection and cherishes the friendship between them, leaving far away for July. The final ending is the reversal of the ending of the novel, which makes people feel the helplessness of life and the value of friendship. A good script and a good director directly create a double-yellowed golden horse queen.
