It always bothers me that there is a first person that is more like a commentary, but the rhythm of the story is quite good and there is no muddling at all. but it makes people feel that the relationship between the characters is not fully established because they are in such a hurry. The plot of walking the tightrope in the end is really thrilling, and the visual spectacle established by Zimicis is really breathtaking.
