Everyone has secrets, those who love you may not make mistakes, there is hidden tenderness under the cold face. Life is too limited, can only accompany each other to take a short journey, before leaving, embrace those who have accompanied them. To melt, to nourish, to warm, just as the sun shines on everything.
