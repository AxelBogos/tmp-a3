Like a very uncomfortable nightmare, struggling to wake up only to find that the ghost pressed the bed can not breathe, a bit like watching "Devil Night Corridor" feeling. The first half was so depressed that I felt like I was about to get out of my many years of backlog of depression. Thinking about the long road and possible difficulties, I really wanted to jump off the building immediately. In the second half of the movie, the hostess is really pitiful. Her husband doesn't believe her, and she has to plead with him. And the most terrifying part of the film is the heroine's face, which is so hideous that it looks like a skeleton.
