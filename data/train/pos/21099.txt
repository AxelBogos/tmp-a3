Today's movie ~ Red Baron ~ anyway, he is a hero. Two hours to tell a person's life, the movie is not always a surprise. You know his fate, watching him walk fearlessly to his own destiny, war or long love between children and daughters, you only remember a fightwithgrace. Why I have always been fond of the Germans ~  ~ probably so, I would like to dedicate this film to the trump card of the Air Force in World War I ~ Richthofen. There are, too.
