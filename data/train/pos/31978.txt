Lao Bai didn't go well in the printing industry and then became a poisonist (laughing and crying); the actor was so cute that he didn't have anyone to meet his father-in-law with dirty words; at the end, the kiss band hit the triangle and the 50-degree gray stalk was very funny. Suitable for Christmas and boyfriend hug around the stove to watch.
