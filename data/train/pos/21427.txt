There are three stars in the movie. Give Shu Qi one. The picture is very beautiful. Everyone said that this is Shu Qi's most emotional play. I think it is, from all kinds of bitterness in her debut to the Golden Horse Award in "good Times," her words are resounding: "I'm putting back the clothes I took off one by one." It turns out that Shu Qi can also be cute, but it's hard to fall in love with people who can't read lines well.
