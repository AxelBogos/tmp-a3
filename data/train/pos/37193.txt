After reading Anne's Diary, I understand why I think that the 13 Women of Jinling only want to have four stars, and the better directors are restrained in expressing their emotions. the soundtrack of the camera lines is by no means intended to incite tears, but shows their bones instead of expressing themselves too obviously. or prefer to restrain calm and slow arrival without chaos and excitement of the director. "Mother" and "the Night and Fog in Tin Shui Wai" are all very good, with a neutral and insipid account that viewers can think on their own rather than follow the director's mood.
