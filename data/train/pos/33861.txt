Akira Kurosawa is a Buddha, which is difficult to shake. Akira Kurosawa's films are not only martial arts, but also a kind of scholar plot, Mencius said: I am good at nourishing the spirit of greatness. The so-called person has died while his qi is still alive, what kind of gas is this: the spirit of disease like the wind, Xu Rulin, plunder like fire and motionless as a mountain, just as the so-called vast righteousness is there, it can still protect itself, but history is moving forward after all, and the spiritual aristocracy can not resist the attack of muskets, just as human society cannot stop the alienation of human beings by instrumental rationality. If you are reflexive and sincere, you can't win. Whether traditional or modern, it is a bloody and muddy road. Shadow samurai, self or fantasy, which is the real self? after being controlled by fantasies for too long, they finally become fantasies. At the end of Akira Kurosawa's film, the camera became dignified and slow, and the music was compassionate. This was a kind of feeling. The horse ran so beautifully, and Zhang Yimou stole a lot of teachers.
