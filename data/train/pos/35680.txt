What a beautiful cult movie. Every filth on the midsummer night in the sunny wilderness is clear and beautiful, the wildflowers in the valley, the white Nordic fabric, everyone with a simple smile on their faces, the evil plasma that is so sweet and so sweet to drink together and go crazy. (overexposure has a wonderful effect on weird rendering to the distortion of the supernatural like a daydream.
