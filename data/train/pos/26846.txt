It is not as important as the previous film because there are too many traitors in the plot; Takeshi Kitano's self-inflicted revenge "there is something he has to do"; Huada sees the wind to make Nomura fall apart and Nomura is not a gangster; the mountain king will rebel against Valin and rebuild; the venue will be shot to seduce and set up a bureau; a conscience in the Matsu Chongfeng gangster movie.
