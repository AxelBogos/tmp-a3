It lasted long enough to forget the spoiler in the review. Very gripping suspense film classic, frightening step by step. After 70 minutes, I was ashamed that I had only guessed the ending, and I found that others could go a step further, so I was more ashamed. When I think about it, it's not so hard to guess, so I'm even more ashamed. Haha. John Cusack was still handsome at that time, but after reading the works for nearly 2 years, the highest score was only 4.5.
