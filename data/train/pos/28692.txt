The whole story is not bad, but the whole story is full of unsightly Notre Dame bitches and magic plots that destroy the ecological environment and biological chain. I don't feel like a bitch is not the role of this movie. Finally, the heroine is normal, and a little Lori is cheap. In order to expand the worldview, forcing humans to coexist with dinosaurs?
