Ha 7 is a hit. Apart from 1, I can't remember which movie I watched. Ha 1 was seen in Asia. When the owl sent a letter to Harry, the cinema seemed to do special effects, a gust of wind, or did I imagine it? But I told people around me more than once that I don't remember much about the plot, and when I will watch all eight episodes again.
