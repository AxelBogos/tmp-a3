In fact, I was looking for a documentary about Napoleon. As a result, the film was made. The first half of the film is laid for a long time. The pace is slow. And a little dull. But when Napoleon did the BE dance on the stage. I was startled. Is that the mediocre Napoleon? Except for Napoleon whose name has no bright spot. There are always some people around us. It has been ordinary for a long time. But there was a flash at some point in time. Lit up.
