I liked it at that time, but I still appreciate it today. The golden and resplendent color blocks of the glazed Palace are laid out with heavy colors, reflecting each other with the drama as much as possible, the exquisite dazzling and decadent killing in the palace is repeatedly rendered, each layer of painting gives birth to more sorrows and sighs, being born in the court is the original sin, the brilliance of the crown is poison, and the adaptation of the text may not be successful, but the sense of fatalism at the origin of the dynasty storm is bleak.
