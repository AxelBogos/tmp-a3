Looking at Roger Ebert's comments, there was a burst of urine: the hero is from North Africa, and Germany is a strange world to him. One day after breaking up with Fassbender, he ran to stab three people somewhere in Berlin. Then he went back to Fassbender and said, "now you don't have to be afraid anymore." finally, he hanged himself in prison. So I would like to believe that this is Fassbender's own story, so it is very moving and gentle.
