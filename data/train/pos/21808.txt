[140129] this is called a Chinese horror movie, full of feelings. After all, it is not a zombie movie fan. I feel that the editing in some places is not very clear about the plot. For example, I do not understand why the three-legged cat Taoist priest went to get Uncle Dong's body. In the end, he only understood it after watching Douyou's analysis. No, no, no. The horror play in front is very scary, and the back turn makes people feel good, high-quality works.
