The story is very good, changing the past in this way. It has never been explained what caused Bruce's plane crash in the same year, and the lack of such a reversal to reveal the truth has changed history. A few little foreshadowing were buried very carefully. The plot is full of excitement and suspense, but it is a pity that the emotional description of the hero and heroine is not very persuasive.
