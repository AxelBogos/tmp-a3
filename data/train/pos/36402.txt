The city of God, the godless land abandoned by God, the real hell on earth. There children steal, rob, sell drugs and kill each other in order to fight violence. Killing is an instinct, a pleasure, a proud show-off capital. The vain attempt to become the master of God, such as the replacement of running water, was finally lost in this crazy feast. What remains unchanged is the idea eroded by the system, the broken moral code and the fate of death whether to escape or resist.
