When I looked at it when I was drowsy last night, I thought it was good to fast-forward at that time, the scene did not change, all kinds of apathy of various units and individuals, my wife did not answer the phone, maybe it was jet lag or maybe they were not in love, playing two-star sleep. After going through the film reviews this morning, I re-watched the last 20 minutes and found that it was really a masterpiece. His wife loved him, and help arrived, but it was Mark White who was found. The FBI had lied about rescuing Mark.
