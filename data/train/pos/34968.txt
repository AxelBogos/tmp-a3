The word is poor. It's so great that I don't know how to praise it. The means and details of creating suspense such as horror visualization / sound effects are perfect, and the best are the real character building and emotional core, sincere emotion, firm courage and pure love must be able to overcome fear. This is also the consistent humanistic care in Jin Yeh's works, which is so touching. Children choose a good cast, each one is so cute, Eddie makes me spit blood.
