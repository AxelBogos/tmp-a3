There is nostalgia, and it is really touched, especially the ubiquitous sound processing, which is great to return to the same place. But in addition to nostalgia, the overall narrative still lacks a strong enough support, or a tipping point in expression, whether it is the tide of layoffs, the changes of the times or even the growth of teenagers. Maybe this is the original intention of the director's private Xiang? But on the whole, I like it.
