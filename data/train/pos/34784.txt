Although the plot in the first few minutes is slow, it delicately portrays the characters and character, making it plump and three-dimensional, so this slow heat is very necessary. Behind the anti-detection part of the strict suture basically no urine point, a few reversals are very surprising. For those who like Indian song and dance dramas, it is suggested that there is no dance in this film, which is very novel. I can't stand that Indian movies often carry songs and dances. I suggest that there is not a dance in this film.
