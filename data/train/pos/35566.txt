There is a cartoon-style beginning. With regard to the development of human nature after breaking the balance, in an ordinary society, it is normal to be a little careful and selfish and can not reach the standard of good and evil.

The director tells a story that looks calm but earth-shaking to the parties with gentle daily life and beautiful scenery. Almost all conflicts are private and undercurrent.
