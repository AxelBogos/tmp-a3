From the fascinating beginning to the affectionate end, the two-and-a-half-hour feature film is not dull at all, and the rhythm is great! The performances of the two powerful actors are unparalleled, the Alpacino teachings are enough to remember the performances of journalistic textbooks, and their insistence on idealism and journalistic professionalism is moving. What's more, it has set up a height that journalists can't reach-- a good film that every journalist should see!
