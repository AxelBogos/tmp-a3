Qiu Litao is really the first person to dare to shoot a Hong Kong B-rated film. Everyone is talking about the theme of emotional output, anti-drug, birth, love, friendship, the rule of law, or feelings. I guess they just throw away a lot of comfortable value to cope with censorship, and then release their hands to stimulate the fierce bloody battle in the Central subway station. It is also a great skill to shoot commercial types of popcorn chips to the extreme of the system.
