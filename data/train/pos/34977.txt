I watched the first film with her in class, and the mood at that time had nothing to do with the movie. Those who ran and chatted together, walked in the supermarket together, changed examination papers, ate fried rice, roasted sweet potatoes and bought electric blankets complained about the days when the headmaster punished students for fighting for stools and singing. Good memories will always be good, no matter whether I know the result or not, no matter what the result is, I will cherish and love her. I can let her go.
