Tells a traditional story in a non-traditional way, the plot context and means of expression are very similar to [out of control], but the perception is completely different. The choreographer is quite successful in depicting the physical and psychological changes of the hero. The feeling of confusion, fear, excitement, thirst, hunger and despair is reborn in a large number of carefully designed subjective scenes. ★★★☆
