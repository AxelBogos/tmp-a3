Cure of the year. Ali played the role of Tang, which is so beautiful that people are fascinated. Because the highest beauty is a kind of carving. I'm not that black, I'm not that white, and I'm not that manly, so what do you say I am? The director's interest is not to discuss the issue of racial discrimination at all, but to struggle with political correctness, the pattern is too small. What the movie really wants to say is "freedom". How on earth should people live in order to be relieved and "free"?
