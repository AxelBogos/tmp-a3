The special article unexpectedly gives some "black mirror" feeling. Still cold and humorous as always, I don't know what will happen next. I feel empty at the thought that I will never see Roy and Moss again. When the trio finally walked out of IT Department, they really wanted to cry. It was only after the end of the play that I heard and began to watch, and experienced another form of humor. Although it was not long enough to fall in love, it was really worth it this afternoon!
