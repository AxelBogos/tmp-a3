The first half is funny, and the second part is profound, which is really a good film of Alpacino, but in my opinion, it is not as good as the Godfather, in which he is a winner, and in this he is a loser, two completely different kinds of people, but he is played alive by him. This film teaches us that in order to defeat those in power, we can only drag them into the vast sea of people's war.
