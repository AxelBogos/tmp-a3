The king finally sees the king! Tell the warmest and beautiful feelings with the most violent and brutal stories, but convey the most heartbreaking despair. This is a rare cult fantasy film in a Chinese-language film. Zhou Xingchi and Tsui Hark achieve the "Chinese Star Wars Dream" that Zhang Yimou tried to achieve through the Great Wall: to build a truly oriental commercial IP series.
