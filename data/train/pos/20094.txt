From primitive society to agricultural society and then to capitalist society, Huang Bo put a theory of social evolution on the big screen. However, on the whole, he holds a rather nihilistic attitude: it is unreliable for the capitalists to be in power, and neither are the people at the bottom. Well, it can't be extended any more. Although Huang Bo finally chose to believe in the truth, goodness and beauty of human nature, this part is enough to make this film one of the most discussed Chinese films in 2018.
