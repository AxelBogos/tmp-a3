The character is a traditional tough guy, impulsive and intuitive, but the emotional conflict is also very good; although it is also a suspense detective film, the character description outside the plot is also very meticulous. Unexpectedly, Uncle Hugh had an answer when he prayed for "god help me". The rhythm of the movie was much better after 20 minutes. I didn't think there was a more depressing film than detachment.
