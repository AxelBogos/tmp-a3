# BIFF# Lansmoss is good at throwing the audience directly into an absurd situation, and the dystopian at first glance is a living reality. Black humor is stronger and more tricks are played than "Dog teeth" (slow motion / perspective-specific VO), but the heterogeneous world is imaginative but too direct and lacks subtlety.
