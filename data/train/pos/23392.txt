A typical linear narrative Hollywood film. Although there are not many hot spots in the story, it is worth seeing for Monroe's beauty and singing. In addition, I personally feel that the love color of this film is not strong. Even if Monroe finally sat on the piano and sang eloquently about River of No Return, if the hero hadn't suddenly appeared, I would have thought it was helplessness to people and things gone forever. Combined with Monroe's life, I can't help but sigh.
