The last time I went to the cinema to see the animation was "Crazy primitive Man". I was very impressed. I was surrounded by a man in his 30s who looked serious and dignified, but kept crying and laughing while holding Coke throughout the movie. This is probably the charm of DreamWorks. Today, there are many adults in their twenties and thirties who watched the Great Sage with me in the cinema, and their reaction also reminded me of that thirty-year-old man. This is really one.
