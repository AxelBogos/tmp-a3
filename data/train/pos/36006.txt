When I watched it, I thought that the director and the screenwriter should be the same person, but I didn't expect that the leading actor was him.
Although the happy ending is a little unreal, thanks to him for having the courage to give himself a beautiful ending, I am willing to believe it. I kind of know why she loves him. I believe she loves him. At the same time, I am not surprised to say this to the director. "I never trust anyone, nor love anyone. Because humans are so cunning. Cunning here, cunning there, cunning everywhere. A pathetic, hateful cunning. " The film is not a metaphor for life, but a metaphor for dreams. A metaphor for dreams mixed with cruel reality and naive wishes.
