It's pretty. I don't understand why the score is so low. Too long time is certainly not an advantage, but the suspense atmosphere is very solid, the lens is beautiful, the rhythm is very good, the sound design is also very good, the story is not new, but it is told very well, I just like such "well-made" films. Towards the end, I thought it was another detention island, but the plot was real. Dai Hanhan is very popular.
