The reason for their struggle is not to change the world, but to keep the world from changing them. It is precisely because of this world that everyone sweeps the snow in front of his own door and does not care about the frost on the tiles of others, which makes everyone turn a blind eye to tragedies-which is probably why the film is called "the melting pot". This movie is not so much about something in Korea. After watching it, it feels more like something that will happen in China. In short, this film is very abusive.
