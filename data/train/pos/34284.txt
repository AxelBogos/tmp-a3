Although there are not many people on the stage, the acting skills of the main characters are quite good, even if they are villains, they are not annoying. The logical reasoning in the play is very strict, and there is no made-up information. In fact, the concept of stealth of consciousness is quite close to the whole department of online games. It is an upgraded version of VR, and it is also science fiction with a realistic foundation. It's worth seeing!
