Han Han has read a lot of books, but I really haven't read this one. I didn't send it to compare it with the original. But there are still the characteristics of Han Han reflected in it, a touch of humor, not hypocritical, not beating around the bush, a most common protagonist, very good. I may not have learned anything after reading it, but I will feel the same way. It seems that the book is on, let's go back to the movie, in fact, the disadvantage of this film is that it is not like a movie, it is more similar to video and long-time micro-movies.
