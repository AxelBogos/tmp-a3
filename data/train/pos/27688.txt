The main line of the story is very clear, but there is such an obvious sense of fragmentation in the history of growth, because Wang Baoqiang does not have a sense of existence in the second half. Aaron Kwok shines brilliantly and fights beautifully.

Mainland directors still don't understand the true meaning of martial arts films. 4. I'm sure Wang Xueyi will appear again in director Chen's next play.
