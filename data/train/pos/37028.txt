I vaguely remember the individual plots in the film when I was a child, but I didn't know my grandmother's name at that time. I have the honor to take a look at it today. In the 1987 film, the wonderful suspense was set as the foundation for the secret room suspense films from now on to now. But it has been imitated and never surpassed.
