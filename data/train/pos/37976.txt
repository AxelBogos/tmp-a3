Jaroslava Schallerov รก and Helena An arrow zov รก are pure and noble with blood-dripping flowers in black earrings, granny devils, religious fanatics, wild temptations, orthodox hypocrisy and debauchery, uncut pomegranate burnt skunks. This film can be described as imaginative to the extreme, and everything is like being psychedelic, light and full of sexual consciousness through the tulle and having fun without adultery.
