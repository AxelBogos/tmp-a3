The dog knows what the brother knows, and the dog knows what the brother doesn't know. Even if the dog is discarded, he has to look for his brother's voice. Such a dog, extremely loyal to follow, even if the last moment of life, the eyes are almost out of sight, but also to protect the little master. Sigh, in the memory of the petals flying, there is a sister, there is a "heart".
