A movie that was a big hit at that time. When you think about it, it was 10 years ago! Hong Kong directors like er Dongsheng very much. Later, in the dark night of Mong Kok, I saw a different but equally brilliant er Dongsheng. The story of small potatoes is touching. Music of the same name is not a new love, but also a masterpiece. I just don't know how I would feel if I looked at it again today, but it must be different.
