Films that are very skillful and handled wisely should be used for reference by producers of sensitive, controversial and difficult films. To set the opposition between the Lebanese and the Palestinians, on the one hand, the choreographer and director are Lebanese and have an understanding of their own national history, and on the other hand, they avoid directly describing the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is a more serious and more difficult contradiction to understand. In fact, the root causes are still concentrated in Palestine and Israel. Judging from the film, the director himself may be unreasonable to Israel in reality. Even if there are only three points, the behavior is critical, and there is no support for the tense character of people of all ethnic groups in the Middle East, but in a turn of words, every nation here has experienced war and witnessed massacres, and they all know what real pain is, so we should understand each other more, and the appeal verdict is in place-- you see, although we Israelis have deficiencies. But we are truly civilized, advanced and high-profile. The director has a professional background in the end, unlike similar countries and theme films, the quality of this film is obviously strong and mature.
