Awesome, the last 40 minutes, too tm burning, will be full of controversy and drama of the 1972 basketball Olympic history, filmed into a legendary human epic!
The result can be clearly seen from the name profile, but so what? The process is still thrilling, blood boiling, eyes filled with tears, thoroughly dripping, there is no way not to applaud.
The director's shot scheduling, conflict design and rhythm control can not be better ah, under the premise of absolutely ensuring a high degree of reduction, through the film art processing to release tension, I am completely blown up.
I believe that no matter those who play basketball or those who do not understand basketball, there is no way to reject its spirit of inheritance.
Originally, this is competitive, this is team sports, this is the charm of basketball, this is the human nature we all have in the face of countercurrent perseverance.
The film even reflects the political issues at that time, as well as humanistic care. Belov did die of illness soon after he threw in the last shot. Similar works, I think that "defeat Munich" is better than "Bohemian Rhapsody" ~
