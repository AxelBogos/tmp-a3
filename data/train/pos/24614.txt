I can't believe there's still a horse! Before I saw it, I thought it was good to live alone, but after watching it, I prefer to live alone. At least you don't have to explain and try to be accepted and understood. Make yourself interesting, but not step on other people's bodies. Or like ha, try to chase the dream, even in a different way.
