Superman in the DC cartoon is told by the ship that he will lead the world, while the movie star is told that he will conquer the world. The movie satisfies my fantasy about the different destinies of Superman. As a teenager with divine ability, he should listen to his parents honestly, be kind, be willing to be a "savior" hidden from ordinary people, or use his powers as he pleases. Be a "magic child".
In my opinion, the film does not simply use the dark version of Superman as an eye-catching gimmick, this is a bold idea: when Superman's contempt for the lower human beings trumps the sense of identity, what kind of "savior" does adolescent rebellious impulse create?
So, don't take anything home, even if it's a child.
