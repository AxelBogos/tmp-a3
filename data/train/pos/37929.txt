The historical repertoire of CCTV has our great historical style, compared with British and American historical plays. Now look, Liu Xiaoqing is a good actor. With Bao Guoan and other old actors, it is quite wonderful. I didn't understand it when I was a child, but now looking back, the play is well-produced.
