The most heartbreaking film I have seen in this period. When the cruelest and most ruthless criminals meet the most determined and persistent Avengers, they end up losing both sides. The film does not simply show the pleasure of revenge, the second half of the film basically makes people reflect: can revenge really relieve pain and hatred? The answer is actually no, and in the end, the Avengers basically ruined their whole life.
