I like this movie better than Anne Hall. As a movie lover, he is always daydreaming in front of the screen, foolishly unable to distinguish between the real world and the illusory world. However, people will eventually return to reality and may sit in front of the screen again, just as Mya Farrow finally smiled like the Mona Lisa.
