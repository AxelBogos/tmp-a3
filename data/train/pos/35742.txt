Maybe I have more empathy for this one, but I don't think there is any affectation. My son burst into tears twice (crashing into the wall and crying in prison), and I couldn't stop crying. Even the Jeremy played by Ang Lee's eldest son feels real! That kind of father's feelings, father and son, family fetters, really touching, helpless and sad. There is also a bold and sharp description of the political victims in the special era. Lang Xiong's performance is also impeccable.
