Aesthetics of violence, Gothic, punk. After watching various versions of "Flying Bedlam" for so long, Sucker Punch made me understand that if you don't have a good story and script, then all the other movie elements must be the best, so we don't have time to care about the script. Just like when Lori dances in the movie, no one cares about what's going on around her. This is also the truth.
