Four stars; Xavier Dolan made another masterpiece after "I killed my Mom" in 2009. Obviously, he fell in love with slow motion this time, and the picture and soundtrack had the flavor of "in the mood for Love". In the film, he acted in an enemy play with the heroine, but the plot was relatively weak and lost to the previous film. This Brokeback genius is very cute!
