In fact, it is a very light film, but I like the way your motorcycles ride at the end of the road, the brilliant vast fields, large tracts of clouds, bright light. And your hallucinations, your fragility and caution in extinguishing the fire, you whispered, I do love you. But there was no answer. People say that God's favourite people die when they are young. You said that your work would outlive you. -to River.
