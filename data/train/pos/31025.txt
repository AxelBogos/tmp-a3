The plot is simple, not as good as the one I saw before, which is a bit parody, but there are three favorite TV actors, such as Beauty lie, Shaoling Wolf and Hemlock. The plot is that several dead good friends go to Mexico for spring break and then go to an abandoned church to play games because they come across a stranger to lead them there. When she came back, the hostess found that the strangers on the table, the car and the onlookers were talking about truth or dare. The hostess began to feel wrong. She asked questions in the order in which death came, and other people could not see the change. Only when it was their turn would they appear. After choosing a big adventure, male n did not implement it, and later fell to death. The male Yaran pointed a gun at his father and begged for mercy and did not be shot to death. The male master did not love female 1 and loved female 2. The female master said that the father of female 2 committed suicide because of what the female master said. After finding the opening woman n to ask the reason, she shot and killed the woman n to drink a bottle and walk on the room. Found a solution, chanted spells and cut out his tongue, but still did not control the man to kill him, and then committed suicide. The two women later put an end to the matter all over the world through the Internet. The game of death here is so big that it is either shot or burned.
