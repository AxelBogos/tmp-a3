A secret about two people who are lonely to the bottom. It's a forest island, it's a carnival in the rain. It is also a film that is difficult to describe, passers-by know it tacitly and smile at each other. The director is an out-and-out genius, and the details, editing, soundtrack and setting are all endowed with a deeper meaning-perhaps the person who calmly watches the film has a lonely soul buried in the depths.
