The leading role of the little man is really vivid, read the introduction that the male host's mother also passed away, let him have this kind of feeling, so when acting in this also more real. The shape of the tree monster is very good, and all kinds of landscape paintings tell stories reminiscent of Chinese pen and ink painting. I'm a little confused about what those three stories are about. The monster filmed is really huge, especially in the house, in the canteen, in the hospital, at grandma's house, really too big to fit, and looking forward to the director's new film.
