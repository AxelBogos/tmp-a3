I saw this film on December 11, the first scene in China, and the whole film revealed a strong Beijing flavor. Wu Yifan in the film had a playful look in his eyes, and his acting skills were commendable, from Tan Xiaofei with silver hair in the first half of the film. to the teenager in home clothes and black hair in the second half, and in the end of the film facing the old gun running on the ice, although he didn't say a word. The resolute eyes, the strength of the masseter muscles and the falling tears are all convincing.
