The famous 3p literary film, even in 1962, Trevor could still show that I liked the relationship between Joe and Jim. Catherine, who was crazy about them, annoyed me so much. If she was the heroine of Budapest love and let many men commit suicide for her, I would like to see that Catherine's selfishness and unselfishness changes so fast that she doesn't see her for love. What love has done is nothing but some of its own wayward actions.
