Sure enough, it is almost the same as the story in "Genius on the left, madman on the right". Alternative tender sci-fi movies. It's a fun illusion to give people a mental hospital. Ha ha. Ost is very good, the atmosphere is set off to the end. Kevin Spacey is good at acting. It's just a little old-fashioned in the end.
