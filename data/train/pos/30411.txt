The camera, the costume, and the actors all cried! In fact, I personally feel that the novel is more coquettish, while the movie has a little more fresh feeling. In particular, the picture of the four sisters walking in the flower rain is super beautiful, and all kinds of small details are also very moving. Is the second brother-in-law's obvious ambiguity to Xuezi a bit too much because the second brother-in-law is too handsome XD?
