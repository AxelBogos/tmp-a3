I can't understand the logic of "essay first". First of all, the female master has no idea of "insisting" to change the male master at all. Everything has been said to be imperceptible; secondly, everyone has his own ideas, and the other person you agree with may not necessarily agree with you, just like you and me now, if you are here to influence people's evaluation of the characters, how do you have the right to guide the female master's behavior? Secondly, will the male lead a good way of life in the future? A person who is not good at dealing with people, no friends, no lovers, no offspring, eventually his relatives die marginalized by society, no considerable job, no income, and eventually either commit a crime or end up depressed? That's your opinion? Besides, how many people you will meet in your life who will change you, from your parents to an old man who makes a coffin, or do you pop out of the stone and have mature thoughts without the influence of others? Please remember that society is not your own society.
