3.5 points anti-German drama is unexpectedly so convincing! A T346 shell showed ups and downs, but the Russians made this kind of patriotic film with its own unique narrative, although it was bullshit, but it had to applaud with one enemy, multi-captain commander's heroic execution and amazing insight. the driving skill of the master has created a unique image of four Russian commanders and German fingers. The setting of the old enemy has added a lot of details to the film, such as the tank battle, the details of the battle in the cabin, everyone's mental state and the bgm tank shelling. "for the sake of the motherland! Wula! " The underestimated Russian war movie is the best war Russian film I have ever seen.
