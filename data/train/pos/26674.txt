Chibi divided into upper and lower episodes is good, because the audience is familiar with the whole story, this divided into upper and lower episodes is indeed a suicidal idea. But it doesn't make sense that the score of this film is lower than that of Fatty Wang's Macao Fengyun 2. As for the question of expectation, everyone's requirement for Wang Jing is much lower. It's just a laugh, but it's different for John Woo.
