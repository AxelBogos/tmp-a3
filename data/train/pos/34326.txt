Except for a little procrastination in the plot and the remoteness of the photography occasion, everything is so clear, a person's depression, a planet called depression, a film that causes tens of millions of viewers to struggle with depression, no illusions, no fantasies, and you can't put the score down just because you don't understand the detailed description. Apocalypse is issued inside, resonance is produced in the heart, what a special film, I like it.
