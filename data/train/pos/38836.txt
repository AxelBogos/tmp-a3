87x100 children are very innocent and children seldom have troubles, which is the reason why we miss childhood. However, children are the weakest, and all the helplessness, damage and tragedy in the adult world are the doom that children cannot escape, and eventually they have to face and bear it. The well-structured script of "Florida Paradise" conveys this message, and the lens design is excellent. In terms of performance, I stand in this film for both female and male partners.
