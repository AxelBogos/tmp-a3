In fact, the logic of the film is a little loose.
It is said that Tom "talent" is definitely not because his modus operandi is flawless-he has a big seam. It's just the plot.
If you insist on saying that he is talent, I think it should be his luck, his daring and his ambition.
This film makes me feel comfortable in two places.
First, the plot is compact and the narrative logic is strict (not plot logic), which can arouse the audience.
