The legendary film that subverts the three values is actually all right-the story of two men and a woman traveling with three people can be found on sets all over the world these years, and it is Spain, and everything is normal. A very powerful movie tells a cool story with a few scenes and colors. Although it is a completely different theme, what I think of is that "butterflies are free" that I came into contact with in high school. I don't know what the public think.
