The story of the German concentration camp in World War II, told from Hart's perspective, shows the honor, courage, responsibility and sacrifice of soldiers. Racial discrimination, murder, court trials, and tunneling were all designed by the colonel, not to escape from prison but to blow up the German arsenal. The colonel's final heroic sacrifice saved many lives.
