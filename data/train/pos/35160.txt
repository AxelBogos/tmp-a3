A musical that really gets into the hole. Love version 00! After reading the 12th edition, I just think it's all right. I feel that my face is expressionless and my expectation is not high. As a result... I played the 00 version a few months later. Oh, my God! This edition is too emotional, the performance is too delicate and moving.. I feel sensual overload in the whole process. Probably poked my rotten point, ha. Full of affection, super love
