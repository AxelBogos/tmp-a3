You are a slave to the past.
A man's past is his glory.
No, my honor lies in shaping the future.
As a matter of fact, the gods are strong, and they do not have the responsibility to protect the world, just to be "interesting", and the concept of time is also different. They can do "free" entertainment for hundreds and thousands of years, and sometimes they are busy doing other things. if there is no time to respond to the feedback of human "games", there will be no miracles. But there is no denying that the power of God is very powerful.
