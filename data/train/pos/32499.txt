The first movie this year that made me want to yell at God! The perfect match between Orson Wells and Kafka, from judicial trial to judicial trial, the whole film is like a grotesque magic flower rising from the soil of the system, conveying the fate madness of small potatoes in the continuous spatial transformation. Ah, ah, ah, ah! suddenly obsessed with Perkins! I had no feelings for him when I watched Psycho.
