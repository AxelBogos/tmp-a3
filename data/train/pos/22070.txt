2012 Sundance Film Festival: nominated films in the American feature film unit. I don't know why this American independent film quite catches me. The actors are mediocre, the heroine is even not good-looking, and the plot is average, but I think it's probably because everyone has a part of idealism. The more I can't go back, the more I want to go back. Grotesque is real.
