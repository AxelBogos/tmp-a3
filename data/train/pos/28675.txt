The plot of this film is relatively simple, but it has actually made great progress in the fight. Played for about 30 minutes, and Bay in the fight with Broli Vegeta and Sun WuKong's reaction and moves are different, the producer is trying to use action plays to show the character, this is the previous Dragonball does not have.
