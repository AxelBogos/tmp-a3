I feel that boys will not understand this film because this is a woman's affair. Although the ending seems to be a little hasty, it also seems to end at the right time, otherwise it will be more difficult to finish. The song soundtrack in it is also very pleasing to a girl's mind. Friendship is sublimated here, and the so-called people who know you best are the ones who give you the most headaches. Maybe that's why this film doesn't look ridiculous.
