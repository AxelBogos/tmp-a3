I really complained for Yu Baimei and Deng Chao about all kinds of bad reviews on the first day of release, and I was going to see how bad it was today. I was going to see how bad it was at the beginning, the character was very rich, the graphic design was great, the photography and the camera was also good, and it was good to see that the development of the middle plot was very attractive, and I was really moved at the end. It was obviously a sincere work. Why was it devalued like this? It just breaks the heart of a person who really wants to make a good film. where's the tolerance?
