I feel that Andy Lau's line of subtraction is not enough, and some of the plots obviously please the audience, but Sister Tao is very restrained on the other hand, and some scenes are very good. But Andy Lau acted very well this time, very restrained. Yu Liwei's picture is a little uncomfortable, and some of the composition is very strange. I have to look at it again to see if it is an illusion.
