There is violence, fierce, but do not feel bloody, but very beautiful, fight there casually stop is an oil painting, as well as bright red flowers on umbrellas.
When I woke up the next morning, some of the scenes in the movie lingered and became clearer. When I think of all kinds of people in the village in the city, what comes to mind is that "all living beings are suffering", just like the feeling of going to the fine house in Zhanshan on the first day of the Lunar New year to see the bustling people worshiping the Buddha. The man who makes people feel compassionate, the woman who makes people respect. The last song makes people want to cry.
There is a visual impact, a spiritual shock, and some places can smile. It's a very good movie.
