The film is good for me. Just to say one thing, many people are complaining about the magic medicine. In fact, it seems to me that this medicine is only a means for the director or the author to promote the plot. It can be not medicine but something like a mirror or something. This original work may not be based on real events, but similar incidents of killing each other through mental control do exist in Japan, so it is not bullshit. Above
