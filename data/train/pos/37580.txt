Although it is an old clumsy movie with an exchange of bodies, I watched it while eating lunch, and I laughed so much that I spurted out my rice. This kind of popcorn movie is successful. Finally, this film is really suitable for father and daughter to watch together. Sure enough, every daughter is her father's little princess.
