When I was a child, I watched the video of chinchilla. I don't know how many times I watched it on the Internet and TV. I was finally able to watch it again on the big screen this time. Every time the chinchilla and the sisters piously let the acorn sprout and grow into a towering tree, the wind channel music sounded, tears welled up in their eyes. Only children can see chinchillas, coal worms and cat buses. I really hope adults can see them once.
