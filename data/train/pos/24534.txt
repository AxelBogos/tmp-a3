At first, I thought it was ridiculous. Tang Zhu's acting skills were really grandiose, and Lin Jiadong's character was really absurd, but with the passage of the story, I found a lot of revelations of human nature hidden in the appearance, so even if the acting skills were not good, but the essence of the story is still more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
