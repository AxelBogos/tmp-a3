After watching the movie, I think the whole film runs through love, including the love between lovers, the love between relatives, the herdsmen's love for the prairie and Alan's loyalty to Temujin. Whether it is suddenly out of Lu or Temujin is for love, but one has gone astray, one has become strong and responsible because of love. Some people say it's fantastic, but I think it expresses the awe of God on the prairie and plateau. This kind of awe and respect is a kind of shocking love.
