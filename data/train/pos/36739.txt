There is nothing to say about Hao Lei's acting skills. Tian Mai felt that Hao Lei was the only one in the play when her father died. The plot is too stiff, this dubbing is very awkward, whether the lens should be long, forcing the case not to go up, ah, the age of the music film is too cumbersome, it is better to focus on the depth, in short, it feels a bit irrelevant. Strength, you can't do without something real.
