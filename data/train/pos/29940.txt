Pure popcorn chips have no plot. The three types of hand-to-hand shootout, sniper battle and car fight are all exciting and enjoyable. The soundtrack of the all-night store is hot, and the calm hotel management, body collection team, police and old friends also add color to the film. It is a pity that the pure hand-to-hand combat part is slightly inferior. Boss Theon is an unlucky loser. The biggest problem is why Uncle Qiang doesn't wash his hair?
