The cherry blossom tree and Yang Guifei, who floats in front of everyone, are the signatures of Chen Kaige. Even if he is misunderstood by the public, he has to show the "supreme beauty" that everyone loves, and even make people die for it. The director not only reserved that dignity and style for his countrymen, but also for himself. "Don't bury me, the ground is cold." Zhang Yuqi is a mirror image of Yang Guifei in the original work, which is not stated in the movie. It is estimated that many people will see it strangely.
