The British-flavored film is a little dull, but the best part is simply laughing and cramping when it comes. Although there is something wrong with the sound track, it still doesn't affect the warmth. PS1's like title is one of the features of Kenloch's film, and this time is no exception. PS2 remember not to offend the British postman.
