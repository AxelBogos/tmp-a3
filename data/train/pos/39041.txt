I don't know why the score on DB is so low, maybe it's because the so-called psychic situations here are different from what people generally understand, so I don't think it's scary. But I still think it's good, though it's not scary. But it's very real, really smart, and that's basically what it is. Except that one of the endings was a little fake, the other two were very real. Think about it over and over. Let's make it five stars.
