I haven't seen much of Huang Xiaoming's movie. I think it's pretty good. Except for being handsome, the others look like bandits. But then again, there can also be handsome guys in the bandits, and the cave is a bit messy, which may not be easy to explain, and the scene of the explosion behind it is not real enough.
