Four and a half stars. What a wonderful affection! For the boy, the bomb is a hope, the little boy on the jar is a good friend, and the occasional text message from the bottle is the strength to support him. For a girl who hasn't stepped out of the house for three years, shooting the moon is her romantic interest, and the anti-aircraft performance is her favorite time, when people stop and the world seems empty. The acting skills of the leading actors and actresses are really wonderful. I also want to buy a color machine man!
