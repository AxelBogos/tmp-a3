The name of the film has nothing to do with the first film, or even the film could have another name, and it would be better to launch another independent biography of the criminal, so that the film can be independent and free from the shackles of the series. Movies with the same subject matter will inevitably be used for comparison, but in fact there is no connection between the two films. When fans buy tickets to enter the cinema, they will be greatly disappointed when they find that the contents are out of touch with each other. As a result, it is normal to have a low subjective score. However, objectively speaking, this film is a particularly well-behaved police and bandit film, Wang Jing is really perfect, and the narrative is smooth and complete. In terms of actors, it is played by many old actors, both the inner shaping of the characters and the tension of the performance are very substantial and powerful. Of course, the film still has some logical flaws and plot injuries, but they are understandable and forgivable. Domestic police and gangster films have been chosen many times. It can be said that the stalks have been worn out. You think that deja vu has seen this plot in another film. What can the director do? let the robbers escape the law or end up abusing the police in a street shootout with the police?
