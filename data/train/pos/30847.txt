The Lion King animation classic reproduction, the special effect restoration degree is almost perfect fidelity, more real than watching the animal world, more powerful than "fantastic Forest", the computer finally presents the real lion animal kingdom, and the childhood memories of the 1990s have been reunited for more than 20 years. The song sounded, as if the whole world was quiet, moved by tears, and the zero imax field was worth it. The all-star dubbing is brilliant. I love Simba, I love Mufasa, I love Nana, I love Timon and Pumbaa.
