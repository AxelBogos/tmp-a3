Chinese people hate Taiwan independence most, and some people even scold Taiwan films when they see them. But look, what films have been produced in the past two years when mainland films are booming?. Do you think that our pattern is getting smaller and smaller and that we have seen less and less of the world? we are either "ex 3" or "Wolf Warriors", even if "burst silent", compared with the two Taiwanese films "Blood Guanyin" and "Buddha Plath". Discerning people can see that, don't say we're making progress, don't back up too fast.
