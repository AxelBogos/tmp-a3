If this is Hitchcock, I'm a little disappointed. If this is a suspense film, my understanding of it is a little limited. If it is made into a play, the effect should be better. Grace Kelly exists like a goddess. Hate the hero, he is dominant and strong and annoying. As for the end, I still don't know if the salesman is a murderer! The motion lens is too dizzy.
