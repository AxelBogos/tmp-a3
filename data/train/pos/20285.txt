It is rare to see such an excellent film, there is no spoiler, even the plot can not hide the social problems it alludes to. It was supposed to be a horror movie or at least a suspense film, but it turned out to be a completely different result. I think the best film is like this, really tell you the plot, you don't even know how to deal with yourself if you are the person involved. When poverty becomes a cycle, it is impossible to say that love is the only way.
