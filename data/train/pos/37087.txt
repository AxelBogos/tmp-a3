The concept of time and space is very good. The narration of the poem has a wonderful reaction with the image. Take the ordinary scenery as the image, dig out the poetic flavor. In that long shot, a lot of emotions and details echo each other. The lost emotion is comforted in the circulation of the pledge. Of course, it can also be understood as completing a long farewell in a dream full of time secrets. I'm confused. I need to rebrush it.
