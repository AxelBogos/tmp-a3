Sure enough, the film at that time was so textured. I found that this kind of film at that time was very impressive in rendering psychopathic killers, and it was not as impressive as it is now, but then again, I always felt that this classic article was irrelevant and had nothing to do with Hannibal Line. in the end, parallel lines did not intersect. Judy Foster was no different from now. Hannibal is even more gloomy!
