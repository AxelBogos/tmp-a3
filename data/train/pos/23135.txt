The Gothic dark style, looking at Li Guohao, found that the character and the background of the story are good, and the character is as dark as Batman, but the raven focuses more on revenge and the description of human nature is relatively weak. I wonder if Nolan re-directed it. Will it be possible to become the next Batman Dark Knight, focusing on male makeup as much as the clown?
