You can imagine how much practical significance such a theme has among the American public or the LGTBQ community, far greater than the film itself. But until the second half of Nicole Kidman's mother Lean in came in, that moment directly moved my tears, having such a mother is the spiritual support and support of the boy (the original author), it is a pity that more people are not so lucky. The last opposite scene between the masters was also filled with tears. Lucas was only 23. This is awesome!
