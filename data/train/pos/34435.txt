The huge gap between reality and ideal is unbearable, where there is no hope, there is no need to wait or compromise. If there is really no possibility of understanding between people, why not draw a circle as a prison? And not self-exile? Maybe it's just because there will be animation in the movie, and animation will do whatever those dolls want, will let the brushes roll around by themselves, and will make the big carp and the broadcaster share the same interests. But reality kills.
