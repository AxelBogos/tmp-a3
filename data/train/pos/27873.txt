A plain love comedy, never laughed, but it is worth aftertaste. When Shallow Hal can only see everyone's inner beauty and ugliness, but not their true appearance, he has done a lot of things he has not done, and even fell in love with "one Niu Niu in a hundred". The director tried very hard to tell us not to judge others with superficial eyes, feeling her heart and seeing her soul instead. / / Ps. Anthony Robin is so handsome.
