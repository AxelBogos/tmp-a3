The 78lap100 "Moonlight panic" series, which highlights the subjective perspective with wheezing in the silent environment and the horrific murder, may indeed be suitable for the "Silent place" and "Don't breathe" style that lowers the hearing, so we see the wonderful long scene of the middle Michael entering the room from the street to the window and the sweaty palms at the end of more than 20 minutes. Women become the core of the confrontation, men and the police are brainless, and this new feminist setting is in line with the old version. The dialectical relationship between the patient and the doctor, the hunter and the hunted is put forward in this book, which is a new idea, so we can also see a subjective perspective of the hunter, still with a gasp. The soundtrack basically follows the old carpenter classic soundtrack, and adds a lot of charming electric variations.
