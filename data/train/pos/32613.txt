If you make friends carelessly, you will be gay. Fear of homophobia is a deep cabinet of truth. Dare to face up to your heart is the biggest signal on the way to growth. The character is novel, and I am curious about the result of the last thing handled by the second man. I hope to see him dare to know himself and grow up. Beautiful soundtrack, young and pleasing protagonist, stable and appropriate rhythm, concise and meaningful lines, this should be the most comfortable youth / homosexual film I have seen in the past six months, and the score can actually be a little higher. The girl friend of the male lead who likes to wear fake handfuls has a lot of personality. I like it too much. Another small deficiency is that I don't understand the part of promiscuous sex after drinking. Where is "promiscuous sex" reflected? Until the right person shows up, you may be confused about your true sexual orientation for the rest of your life, but isn't it the best thing to have a sexual experience with the person you love? Nothing is mistake. Flare-like gorgeous but short youth, discrimination and lies also coexist, I wish you to chop off, stay awake, love what you love.
