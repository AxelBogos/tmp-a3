Apart from the hard wounds such as whether the physical structure and logical program of the robot can produce consciousness, store consciousness and how to transfer consciousness, I really like this film very much. it is almost ethically discussing the question of whether a conscious robot is still a robot. When the female bandit saw the robot like a newborn baby, the natural outbreak of maternal love was really touching. It's the best science fiction movie I've seen so far this year.
