In fact, what I mainly want to see in this film is to see how Dapeng, ou Hao and Sha Baoliang portray characters in crime films. The first two leading actors made a deep impression on me in the past, but Sha Baoliang, I don't think I have ever seen him act. Happily, everyone's performance exceeded my expectations. In fact, everyone's role has two sides, the director and screenwriter do not blindly make the face of the bad guys, everyone has their own most important things. What impresses us deeply is that ou Hao doesn't have many lines in this play, so he is basically set up by a person who doesn't talk too much. Under this major premise, it is also obvious that after (anti-drama), the severity of his eyes is very different and very persuasive.
