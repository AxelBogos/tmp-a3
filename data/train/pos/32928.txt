I haven't given a movie five stars for a long time. Sometimes there are two situations, one is subjective, the other is objective, which represents that the movie is really worth five stars. Subjectively, it is because the film has moved you or touched some nerve in you. This film should be given four stars, but the story of the film, the inner world of the hero, and the last line of the story completely made me lose my mind. Because a person who will no longer love will die when he sees this.
