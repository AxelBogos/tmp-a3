At first, I thought it was just a ticket play, but the more I saw it, I found that the director was as strong as Hitchcock, and it was really tough, and the rhythm of the film was so good that it was simply out of control in the back. There are too many innuendo and flaws in the plot, but they are all covered up by the brilliance of the director. In addition, none of the actors are good, not bad, four-and-a-half stars.
