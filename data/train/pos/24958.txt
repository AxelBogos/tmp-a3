The plot has nothing to do with 1, and the quality is certainly not comparable to that of the first film, but unexpectedly, Fatty Wang did not slap down this time, who was not optimistic about me before he fully hit me in the face!
With Zhang Ziqiang as the prototype, the plot has the feeling of "building a big tree to attract the wind", but the pattern, tension and the sense of the times are obviously inferior, and even the plot design of the anti-undercover script is simple, and there are small loopholes in some details. for example, why should Lin Jiadong reveal his identity as a policeman when he originally intended revenge? The king of thieves is so relieved to put it in without any monitoring in the room.
However, it didn't hurt. The hard power of the actor lineup played a leading role-Liang Jiahui, the actor of a thousand faces, became more and more domineering as he grew older, and the sense of pressure of the character overflowed from the big screen. Louis Koo also offered a stunning and breathless bomb demolition scene. As soon as Lin Jiadong appeared, his appearance gave me the creeps. Ren Dahua played a soy sauce in a regular way. Several movie stars played opposite each other and played against each other for the whole film. Look at the actors, watch the acting, absolutely clap your hands!
The casting of the female match and the way of taking the stage are completely the style characteristics of the pervert Wang Jing, and you can see that it is undoubtedly taken by this fat guy.
