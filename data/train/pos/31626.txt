The old play bone Meryl is really not a brag! Eyes, movements, lines, temperament are all first-class Queen Fan, and the role is very consistent! Anne Hathaway's innocent and lovely look and demeanor. There is no dog blood at the end, which is very interesting and touching. Don't miss a girl who loves western style. The highlight of this film lies not only in all kinds of luxury goods and European and American high fashion, but also in the inspirational and moving elements.
