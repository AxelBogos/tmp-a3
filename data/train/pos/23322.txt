Originally, I saw the 2010 edition a long time ago, but I really forgot who the killer was. I didn't think of it when I watched the movie today. I kept guessing until the last day.
The two girls who came to see it happily discussed that the film was played by Depp before the opening, and then when Depp came out after the opening, they asked each other who this person was, and almost wanted to go over to them and say, this is Depp.
