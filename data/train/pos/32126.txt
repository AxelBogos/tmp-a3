Imagination! Imagination is the driving force of art! Robot cats used to be so old! This is a special anniversary work, it takes us back to the source of our childhood obsession with robot cats, the fantasy land of endless wild and magical props in the pockets of fat cats! The museum, which specializes in collecting and producing magical props, let us relive the fantasy enlightenment that once made us marvel and yearn for. So we don't mind the bloody plot or something.
