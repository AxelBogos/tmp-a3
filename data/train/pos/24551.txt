I'm not short of a five-star. The soundtrack is very appropriate. I always like to regard the story of Joan of Arc as a wonderful court play. In the face of all the traps, Joan relied on her own beliefs (perhaps the ultimate mastery) to resolve them all. Ever since I saw Bernard Shaw, I have been extremely sympathetic to these God's priests in the heresy. They are full of mercy and cruelty.
