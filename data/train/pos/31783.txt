Wang Fei was sitting on the subway when she went home last night. I saw that she had an empty seat next to her and sat down at once. She was wearing a thin white sweater with a high neck, short braids and thin cheekbones. She still said she didn't want to take a picture. She waved her hand but smiled shyly. I knew she wouldn't shoot or ask, and then I woke up.
