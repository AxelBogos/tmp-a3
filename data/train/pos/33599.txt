I watched a beautiful French silhouette Prince and Princess. What kind of stillness is there in the French mind? It is as if heaven and earth and all things are sacred and ancient to them, and they do not need to pursue fame and wealth as hastily as anyone else. "one sand, one world, one flower, one heaven, hold infinity in both hands, the moment is eternity." I often think that this little poem is written for them.
