In an interlocking black humorous story, each character in the film only grasps part of the truth, and only the audience can see them circling in the maze of blood. For the Cohen brothers' debut independent film, which is a very low-cost independent film, the excellent narrative ability shown is as good as that of an experienced director, and he has a good grasp of the rhythm control and atmosphere shaping of the whole film. The key three shots were arranged just right.
