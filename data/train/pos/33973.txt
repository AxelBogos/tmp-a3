Genius is on the left, madman on the right. When everyone treats them like rubbish and madmen, only Dr. Nice tries to get close to their lonely hearts. The cats raised by Nice actually symbolize these mental patients, lonely, nervous, yearning for freedom, you can never guess what the cat will do in the next second, what if people do the same? Just look at the situation of these patients. "people decide what rubbish is," and often the one who makes the decision is garbage.
