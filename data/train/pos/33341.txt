Why do I remember that the ending was that although the elder brother went back to the place where he used to live, then he ran out to find his younger brother, just at this time the younger brother came to the nursing home, and then it was raining, and they were in the mall, laughing like dancing in the rain, and then it was over. It's so weird.
