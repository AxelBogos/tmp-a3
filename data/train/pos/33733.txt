Zhang Jiahui, what can I say? I don't think there's anything wrong with acting. It's absolutely comparable to A-list stars, but I don't know why I haven't been able to play a leading role for many years. Like Zhang Jiahui, there is no reason, he has basically seen all the films. Whether it is said that he is not good-looking or that he was born at the wrong time, he is undoubtedly the most hardworking and dedicated Hong Kong film! So his maiden director, no matter the plot, no matter the shooting effect, must be given to the five stars.
