The life and death ending was covered by the sound of the trumpet, until the film finished the last row of subtitles, I was still looking forward to the side words of "many years later". I hope Fan Honggen did not die. Maybe in my opinion, he did not deserve to die. His resentment and psychological imbalance broke out irrationally under the action of alcohol, but would it be too cruel to end his life with one of those three gunshots? Qinghong's life is also cruel to her parents, are these all hard wounds of that era?
