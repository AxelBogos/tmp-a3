Give me a score. In the film, the setting of suspense organs, the rendering of the scary atmosphere, and the excavation of human nature, social politics and other aspects, in my opinion, can be comparable to the price of fear. The most terrifying part is the recollection of the old captain, in which the dirty political mission risked the lives of the crew, but the captain who was able to escape death this time could not escape the fate of being buried in the belly of the fish. The simple ending represents the exhaustion after the victory of human will to power.
