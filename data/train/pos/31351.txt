A very exquisite film is actually about how children face difficulties and setbacks when they grow up, and parents learn to let go while protecting and supporting their children. The story is complete and the animation details are perfect. The only problem is that a large part of the story is similar to finding Nemo. By comparison, I think Cat and Peach Blossom Garden is better than finding Nemo. However, the obvious stories are the same. The same role setting makes "Cat and Peach Blossom Garden" at a disadvantage! After watching a lot of bad reviews of this film, most of them feel that the boss who pursues light has to be a part-time choreographer and director, spending money and wasting resources, but since animated films are very difficult to make, why not support such a good-looking film in China? The main problem of the whole movie is the plagiarism of the plot. The animation itself is very good.
