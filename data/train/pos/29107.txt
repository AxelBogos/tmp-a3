After watching it, there is only one sentence in my mind to describe the movie, which is the dark side of the high concept. According to the logic of the film, this dark side is really terrible. When I watched the Hacker Empire, I also thought that the high technology of the future could be so frightening. It's just that the theoretical system of this film is relatively complete, and the film shows only a few things like a peeping leopard, like an ant with an orangutan brain and a weird movie.
