I have been afraid to watch this movie because I heard that it was Bergman's "Ultimate thinking about Human Faith and death" and so on. But the film is unexpected to me, not the obscurity of imagination. Compared with his trilogy of belief, there is no metaphor of image and stiff picture, and the cross-examination about the silence and existence of God is more direct. In short, I think this is "good-looking" in his film.
