# 2018SIFF @ SFC, the number one reason for this comic change is sugar! It turns out that the villain's attempt at sugar really doesn't disappoint, especially in the muscle-revealing scene: the school violence shown in the D film, cyber bullying and other issues also have practical significance. But as far as the role is concerned, as soon as the Lion God has special abilities, he regards himself as superhero, and does wanton slaughter mean nothing?
