The best prison film is much better than Prison Wind and Cloud, with a more depressing atmosphere and a heavier topic. There are many prison films in Hong Kong, and the style is basically the same. Unlike American prison films, which mostly focus on prison break, Hong Kong films mostly criticize the violence of prison guards and gang infighting among prisoners, but there is no lack of splendor. Unfortunately, only Lin Lingdong's two Prison movies are more famous, and most of them are produced at a small cost and have not been repaired, which are relatively unpopular.
