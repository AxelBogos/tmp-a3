The plot is meticulous, much more logical than ordinary Hollywood blockbusters, and it is not pure personal heroism. The beginning and end are clearly explained, and there are no loopholes in the plot logic, but the best part of the whole film is not good enough. There are few big scenes, and as an action film, it is a bit like a plain boiled narrative film.
