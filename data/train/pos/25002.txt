"Snowflake Fan": the friendship between women, which is still a rare theme. The substitute deductive method, parallel editing and literary dialogue all make this film extraordinary. If you patiently feel its delicacy and gentleness, you will find that it is not so obscure. Nominations: best Picture / Best Director (Wang Ying) / Best Actress (Li Bingbing) / Best styling Design / Best Film Music. ★★★★
