The remake of the Spanish film "the Mystery of the female body" (which is the same director as "the Invisible Guest"), the first half of the Spanish film is better and compact, the plot progresses step by step, and South Korea is a bit of a mess. The second half of the film in South Korea is better, Spain makes some kind of relationship a little strange, and South Korea has improved the relationship very well, which seems more reasonable. I love this kind of big reversal suspense film.
