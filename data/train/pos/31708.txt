I love this kind of historical drama, whether it's true or not, it's attractive enough. Judging right and wrong, black and white always have to stand on the same point of view, where can there be absolute? Dialogue and lines are good, Trotsky and Lenin and Stalin twice, Lion, Wolf, Eagle and Duck. You didn't come to my world to visit, but when you reach old age, you are surrounded by memories, flashbacks interspersed with "visits" of magical reality, and skeletons on the faces of people at the end of each episode. "the way of the wicked is like darkness, and they do not know what will fall."
