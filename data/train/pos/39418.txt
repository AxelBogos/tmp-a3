Is it the devil who says it's not scary?! As a veteran horror movie enthusiast, I was scared two or three times in the first episode, and I was going to cry at the end! I really like the director's narrative style with a sense of substitution, okay? And there are no repetitions in every scary episode! It can be said that it is very scary with great care! And this show is really a warm love film with a scary shell! There are many tears! The whole show has too many advantages! I like the tones of all ages! Flashback transition is very comfortable! Young actors and adult actors are a good match! I'm going to blow this piece! PS: I'm not a good person after watching the end of the fifth episode.
