Nine points. A very good vampire movie. The texture is very good, the soundtrack is also good, the thrilling effect is in place, the plot of the vampire into a human part is a little far-fetched, but the other parts are good, the ending design is also good. When human beings are no longer at the top of the food chain, when human beings are reduced to food like pigs, cattle, sheep and chickens, when human beings can choose to be vampires or human beings, when you eat others are also eaten by others. Ethan is so handsome as a vampire!
