The novel came to see the movie when he saw more than half of it, and the film was too beautiful. although it weakened the theory of origin in the original work and changed the interesting things that appeared next to the novel, it inherited the beauty and serenity of Tanizaki Runichiro under the gentle drizzle, and the story characters presented in the film were more concise and beautiful. However, if I want to understand the customs and customs of Kansai in the Showa era, I still think I should read the novel.
