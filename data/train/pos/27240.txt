This film probably has empathy, and what you don't understand is really incomprehensible. The hostess is a complete portrayal of me, the feeling of swinging between fantasy and reality, always an outsider, pretending to be high-minded and sensitive to other people's every move, being shamed by others, ruining everything sadly and indignantly. Finally, the feeling that I can't come down. The hostess finally embraced the reality, but now I still can't do it.
