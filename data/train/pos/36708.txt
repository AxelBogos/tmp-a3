The front is a little slow, the back is very good, there are jokes and feelings, Disney still likes to make this kind of antique film, the final battle with the symphony has a great feeling. That horse is the strongest character in the film, Good job! Still can not help complaining, in front of a group of dead people, behind a hail of bullets no one was injured, really told us that luck is also a kind of strength! The little Indian boy with a crow has a great feeling and likes it very much!
