I really miss my favorite animation when I was a child. I watched it with my brother. I still like it very much. I couldn't stop crying when I saw that the memories of digital babies were cleared. I didn't cry for a long time because of a drama. I didn't have time to eat the instant noodles. I used half of the paper on hand. later, when I told my brother, he said that I was too emotional, but it was really too uncomfortable at that time. Completely involved in the play, they are my childhood ah!
