It feels great, it feels like a shuttle. I was really handsome when I was happy to fight monsters. There are many funny points and touching places, such as the doctor's spaceship, happy to lose his superpower, happy to save carefully, the ball leader, the TV principal and Jia Luo led the masses to protect the stars and planets, which is very touching. It can be said that I cried from half to the end. Is the passage after the end of the film the foreshadowing of the next film? That's what the cinema staff said. In short, support Kaibao, Kaibao will always be the best.
