He will suffer without love, but he will die without camouflage. I think it is the pinnacle of Matt Damon's acting skills. Ripley in the film is selfish, vain and cruel, while shy and shy to pay for the pleasure of his lover. Murder is a terrible crime, but every time he shows up, one can't help pinching a cold sweat when the situation is in danger. Several desperate times can only make people feel sorry for and ruthless when they have no choice but to kill them, and it is embarrassing to see that cancer has been committed several times. Emotional transmission, cute accurate interpretation of this complex role, always let me feel like falling into the ice. Although cute is perfect, after watching Ripley's original candidate, I can't help but wonder what will happen to Norton as Ripley.
