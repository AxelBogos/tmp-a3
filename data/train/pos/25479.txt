It is very depressing from beginning to end, and the incompetence of the police is the key to the delay in solving the case. After the release of the major suspects, no one went to monitor, and for those directly related to the case, they did not check their family background, relying entirely on inadvertently found clues to solve the case. The title "prisoners" is very meaningful, and the ending forces you to think about who the prisoner is.
