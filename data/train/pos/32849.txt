The real protagonist of this tragedy is Brutus, not Caesar. Who better to play Brutus than Ben Whishaw? Just like Richard II, Brutus's mode of thinking is binary extremes; their split personalities are the same, half of them are engaged in politics, and the rest of them just want to be ordinary people, and they all live in some kind of fantasy. It can be seen that both the director and the actor are well versed in the script. The only winner of the play is Octavius, who is the only one standing on the stage of victory at the end of the play.
