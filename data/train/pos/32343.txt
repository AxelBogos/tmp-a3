It's really weird. All of a sudden, I can't find it. The perfect murder case shown in the first half is just laying the groundwork, and the second half is turned into a psychological suspense that is more exciting, guilty and bizarre, how can there be nothing wrong with the heart. There is always a shadow of "shining" in many details, especially the shape of the sitting position with rolling eyes is very similar.
