Fell in love with Harrison Ford, this is a typical American spiritual film, the president himself is a counter-terrorism expert. At first, when he opened as president, I wondered how the film would take him as the protagonist. There are still a lot of loopholes in 1990s films, but commercial films have always been like this.
