One star stingy is not good for the screenwriter, it mainly depends on the acting skills of the actors. But! Knocking on the blackboard really feels much better than the Mekong operation, at least depicted in detail. It is said that the protagonist is open at the end, but didn't Peng Yuyan open it? It is suspected that the one-sided praise of the Mekong River is to establish political correctness by brushing to 7.5. To compare like that, I'd have to give four stars.
