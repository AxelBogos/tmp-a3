Japanese image aesthetics. Firefly, Wenjiao, Sakura, the most handsome man in the trilogy. The story of a man who is down and out like a beggar under an accident and struggles to get the dignity of death. It's still tender. I like such a delicate set, obscure and profound love between men and women. There is no sensual desire, but it is thicker than bone blood. The CP of the trilogy is admirable. Sigh.
