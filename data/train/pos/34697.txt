Wonderful and beautiful! Ziegfei, from a small producer of a circus, constantly innovates and changes, creating one miracle after another. Even if he is questioned in his old age that he has run out of talent, he can still look back. The film shows Ziegfei's super ability and sense of smell to seize opportunities, as well as a variety of coaxing eloquence, showing a very charming character. The most amazing thing is that in that era, the stage performance could be so wonderful, it was an eye-opener! The performance of the picture also revealed the whole performance, especially the part of "revolving cake". It was wonderful! The emotional line is detached from the performance, as well as the light embellishment is just right not reduced to dog blood. At the end of the film, Ziegfei went into decline, flashed back to glory, and said goodbye to the stage completely, really showing the obsession of a genius who was infatuated with the stage and eager for success.
