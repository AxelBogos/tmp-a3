At first, I thought the story was simply about two rich second generations of premature ejaculation who turned into enemies for a lonely woman who was emotionally frustrated. With the appearance of the real gate of heaven at the end of the film, the heroine wandered in the beautiful sea and left a sentence, "Life is like a bubble in the sea. All you have is to plunge into the sea." I can't help but feel that there is a feeling that I can't let go for a long time in my heart.
