The position is basically neutral, the historical details do not know how to restore, among the actors there are several Japanese who are more impressive. American roles are boring, but the bureaucracy in which everyone is fooling around is impressive. The reduction of the scene is quite high. If you go to war, you have to look like a war. The disadvantage is that the back fight is a little procrastinating. The director probably wants to restore the whole attack process as much as possible, but the technique is too simple to look awkward.
