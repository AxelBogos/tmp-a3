Sad, very sad, very sad. The dream is far away, the reality is cruel, and life is not easy. Even if you work hard and strive for survival, you may not be successful, and things often go against your wishes. The story is quite true, but the details are a little false, too many soul chicken soup lines, although reasonable, but not like the usual words, and a lot of "blow" flavor, all do not feel inspirational. As a real actor, acting is very important!
