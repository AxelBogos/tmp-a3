The image of Daisuke in Z and CCA is more coherent, but it seems a little out of touch with the Daisuke in the previous 0079. The two protagonists are similar to each other to some extent: neither likes to take responsibility, but both have a sense of responsibility. Disappearing into the depths of the universe with Aksis is probably their best ending.
