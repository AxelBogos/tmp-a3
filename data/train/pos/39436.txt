The dirty sewer is reminiscent of dreams and the subconscious, and the process of the mermaid being engulfed by pustules and bugs seems to show the man's despair when the man's wife is tortured by a tumor. finally, a close-up of the body (the head of a woman without pustules and a human fetus) brings the situation back to reality. I think it's a good movie.
