It's not as bad as 5.8. The plot is really nothing new, there is no suspense tracking, but there is no weakness. As a crime film, the film does not explain the motives of the criminals, nor does it analyze, because the author is here to tell the story of revenge, to think about the meaning of living, and to reflect on the retribution that good and evil deserve. So those who give very low marks are so obsessed with the mediocrity of the plot that they ignore the author's original intention.
