Will meet, will be parted. None of us are eternally sheltered children. What you have, what you lose, and what the big time is coming, are all meant to be. Make some happy plans with troubled time, be chic yourself in the closed space, add color to the world, give some time to desire, give more freedom to the air, and open your arms to the sun, no matter when and where.
