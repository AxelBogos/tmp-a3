Standard Hollywood popcorn, cool and high, so quite satisfied, as expected! I was fooled by the mechanical dynamics and various fancy mechanisms in the film! There is even a sense of national pride in some segments. Forgive me. But the reality is cruel, apart from the national teachers and cas used for the domestic market, completely made by foreigners, scripts, costumes, soundtracks â€¦ Everything you can do on your own is arranged, and the gap is too wide! There's a long way to go...
