Think of violence and loneliness. In fact, the selection of moral standards is the result of the government's choice. once the right to choose is lost, everyone can not be called a human being, right? Oh, right now. Favorite Kubrick fluent Beethoven music, violent slow motion, sexual fast action scene pictures, and exquisite milk bar.
