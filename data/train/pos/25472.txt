Refreshing film. But it's not that tall. It's better looking than the daredevil next door. The blonde girl is also more attractive than the next door. The only one who doesn't have the routine is the male lead, but he's so Jack Sue, the junior audience of the Walking Dead doesn't think so. In addition, I feel that the man's clothes are suitable for showing breasts.
