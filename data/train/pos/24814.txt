The plot design is good, the part of illusion with dreams is particularly bright, and the special effects are also very good. I really don't see that it is Lin Xiujing. Jiang Dongyuan has a good figure, long head and legs, and handsome motorcycle suit. What I think is insufficient is that the description of the Great God is too little. If you want to see the part of the Great God, you can do it for three hours.
