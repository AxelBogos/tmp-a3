Every time I see an adaptation based on a real event, I will set it up. This means that the conflicts, tensions and dangers we can feel are all experienced by them, and I respect their experience. In the last part, the arrest and escape were interspersed with suffocating tension, but fortunately they succeeded and freedom came! Freedom is valuable, freedom is the most important right besides the right to life and health, but freedom is relative, there has never been absolute freedom!
