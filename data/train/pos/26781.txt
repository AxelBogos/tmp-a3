So Zhi Zhi lived in his childhood as a background and filmed in the field, and the story also incorporated a lot of his own memories. Many details and lines poke people, not one by one. It is true that the character of Uncle Kuan is not a competent husband and father, just like the passing away, which has been mentioned faintly many times in the film, which can not give his wife a sense of peace of mind. Husband and wife may break up, but the bond between parents and children will last forever. "Don't be impressed" sounds good.
