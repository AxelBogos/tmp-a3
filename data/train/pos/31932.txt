The best movie lately. The feelings are sincere and touching. Whitewash the American capitalist class has a good sense of justice. In other words, this is really a disaster, ah, why go back ah, make do with it, it would be nice to create a new York. Thank you Donald Trump at the end of the film. You borrowed someone's house, right? Great mind needs to be saved.
