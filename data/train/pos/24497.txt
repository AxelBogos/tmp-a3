The pseudo-long lens, which takes nearly 80 minutes to the end, is consistent in cohesion. The sense of suspense is weak, the truth is told at the beginning, there is almost no suspense in the whole film, the reasoning is slightly insufficient, and the technique is simple. The key lies in the same scene from beginning to end, the change of the weather outside the window, the evolution of the characters' internal psychology and external performance, the dialogue at the party, and the final game confrontation between the three is wonderful and compact. James has always played the role of God. What else can I say?
