I am a die-hard world fan! This issue of SP also likes the lack of reversal of Nakama's JJ; Xiao Fu's favorite, Li Hui's sister's short curly hair is beautiful to death, and there is even a superficial opinion of Linai; Takahashi's most embarrassing; suddenly that sister's theme is old-fashioned but unexpected to my heart, it is really very important to be myself; the last one scared me for a moment, which was unscientific. I was scared for the first time after watching Shiqi for so many years!
