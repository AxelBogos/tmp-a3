The painting style is fresh and strange, abnormal cure, alternative small and fresh. Children and stubborn old men fight the spiritual epics of the world in the jungle, glimpsing the moment of return to primitive emotion in their growth and redemption, and sharply satirizing the hypocrisy of modern society. P.s. The New Zealand accent sounds fascinating.
