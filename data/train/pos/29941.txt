The core of the plot is quite fond of pursuing top and falling into bottom in his later years. He is lonely, escaping and unwilling to turn back. Of course you think your life is good, but looking at the glittering eyes like golden hair, you can't help but wonder what kind of experience I gave up. The long and chaotic rhythm is very much in line with the mentality of the protagonist. I think when I get old, I may also look at the young people and say why do I have to be free, but I still have to go to the horizon.
