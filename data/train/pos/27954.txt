Good screenwriter, good story. Interspersed with the love story is my favorite tone, there is no sweet talk, no pre-flower willow, nothing more, pick up the gun, throw the gun and take you all over the mountains to catch a white rooster. There is no truth in the film, but there is a human struggle to resist compromise and reconciliation. 2013.7.2 Goa,Anjuna.
