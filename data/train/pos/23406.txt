I vaguely guessed the killer at the beginning, but at the end, I didn't expect that the director was George Clooney, and I knew it when I saw that the screenwriter was the Cohen brothers. Black family is not only a history, but also a sharp contrast from beginning to end. Julianne Moore's performance is close to "ace Agent 2: the Golden Circle". It feels like acting again without Matt Damon.
