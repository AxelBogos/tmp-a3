I have been following the director for several years and I just finished reading the novel not long ago. Although the originality is so high that it seems unnecessary to set the name of the original work, the choreographer and director are really successful this time. The multi-perspective and multi-timeline is a bit like a longer version of "lurking." the sixth episode is composed of several groups of more than ten people with ten-minute long shots, showing off cool. I have never seen a haunted house attack the heart to such an extent, how can everyone be ordinary people? the fifth episode of the little sister is so pitiful that the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters is still so good. Boing, I didn't expect the truth of the red gatehouse in the last episode. Deception in the name of protection is always the beginning of trouble. It is a pity that most of the strange points of ps's original house structure, such as the inner and outer double layers, are only reflected in the opening animation, and the poems at the end of the journey and my mother's dream house refer to the original work a little.
