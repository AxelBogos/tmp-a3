I really like the consistency and absurdity of the combination of reality and reality in cinematic tragedy stories. Is it so amazing that the older I get, the more I like to watch movies with this kind of self-style? Btw likes the angelica Olga inside so much that she is not the leading actress at all. Her aura is much more than her. The whole Olga vase.
