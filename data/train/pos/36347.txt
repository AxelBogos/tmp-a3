A highly stylized movie. Godal is simply writing a poem with a lens, and even if the story is read in a fog, it is difficult to understand its true meaning. It is also excellent to appreciate the mirror simply as a photography textbook. The setting of a happy ending doesn't feel right for the tone of the film, but it warms the heart.
