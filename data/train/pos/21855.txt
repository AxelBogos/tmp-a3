The most perfect character portrayed is Marianne. On the one hand, taking care of her husband shows the firmness of a good wife, on the other hand, she shows restraint in front of her lover and the tenderness of a good woman. She seldom likes the female characters on the screen. Malena, the beautiful legend of Sicily, is one, she is one. When I really look naked, I have no idea that the director is Truffaut. Although I don't say I like it tight, at least the characters are full.
