The main motivations that support me after reading are "see how stupid the Koreans can be" and "Jason Morma, do you want to be so cool and handsome? the protagonist has been robbed of the halo by you"! Play one more star for Jason Morma, the man with talking eyes, the most handsome villain in history, the king of horses in the song of ice and fire, countless women give up the song of ice and fire because he is dead. It doesn't make sense that such a man is not popular! It's a little Depp, probably because they're all Hawaiians.
