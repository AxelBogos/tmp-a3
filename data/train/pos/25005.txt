A movie adapted from one of Brother Shan's favorite novels. Virgo men wear suits, are addicted to collectivism, express opinions on music, are slightly addicted to cleanliness, show avoidant movements to strangers, have a lot of toiletries, maintain fitness and skin care habits, and have sex with women who admire their bodies and muscles in the mirror. There is a demon living inside. This is the story of obsessive-compulsive disorder, the ending can actually be changed to obsessive-compulsive thoughts, and it is fun to tell the truth from the false.
