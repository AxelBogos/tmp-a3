The SB police were coerced by gangs and did not hesitate to kill their colleagues to create the 999 incident and transfer the tiger away from the mountain to complete the robbing task. There are many characters, and the plot is a little complicated, but the group performance is good. Although the end of the fire is exhausted, it still makes people feel lost, perhaps because the details have not been taken into account, and the mood of watching the movie has been suppressed. ★★★☆
