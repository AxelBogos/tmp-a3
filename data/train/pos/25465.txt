Can not find First Degree, saw this film, the feeling of depression from beginning to end. We can fight bravely for fear, but when we know that we have won, we have to face fear again, and all that is left is despair. I was very pleased with the jury's attitude towards Henry. We hate dark and dirty things, but to those who are persecuted by darkness and filth, we often give not sympathy, but disgust and avoidance, which is unfair.
