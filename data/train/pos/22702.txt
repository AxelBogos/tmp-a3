Generally speaking, this film is highly recommended. In addition to the real sci-fi of the special effects, it is a conscience science fiction film, which is more reliable as a whole, and there is no obvious mental disability until the self-destruction part of the base. It is really rare for this kind of science fiction film not to be brain disabled.
