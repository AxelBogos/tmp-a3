After reading it, I thought for five minutes and then cried. It was recommended to me by a brother. Everyone has his own dream, even if your dream has been thrown into the toilet, even if the person who helps you looks dirty in others, the person who works hard for the dream has the most beautiful light in the world. Even if you're already in hell. What others see is your halo, but they always ignore your efforts. They don't know what you've been through. But, man, stand up straight. Don't get down.
