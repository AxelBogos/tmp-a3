A lovely cat and a herbivorous pot met for ten years and five days. The young artists who go to Beijing alone with the aspiration of cartoonists accidentally pick up super cute American short hair, and the storylines are too good. Sure enough, they can only be found in cartoons. The last monologue had obvious tear-jerking effect, and Sakamoto's dubbing and theme song were excellent.
