It's a great group play, and everyone is full of character. It is known from the extremely calm shootout that the film aims to show "style": to give up reality and practicality, and to focus on posing, as well as fantasy static braking. The undisturbed masculine style makes this group of people (Huang Qiusheng, Kaohsiung in particular) quite stylish. Kicking the paper ball is a fashion MV of the five. It's so coquettish.
