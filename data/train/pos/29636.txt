The lines, performances and turning points of this film are all dramatic, but the setting is very complex and exquisite. Frankenstein has a simple heart like a child. Many people regard Frankenstein as a monster just because his appearance is too scary and unexpressive. There are still many misunderstandings in our lives. I think this story can still be made as a sequel, that is, neither Frankenstein nor the bride is dead, and then it becomes an elf hotel or the Adams family.
