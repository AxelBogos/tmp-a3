[four and a half stars] the adaptation of a real story is a gimmick that attracts me, and it's a good gangster crime film. The story runs through religionism and racial discrimination. When the male master gave up wanting to embark on a dream trip twice, it made me sigh how it was so difficult to be a good person. It is said that there is a crime behind every wealth, and the greater the wealth, the more serious the crime. ]
