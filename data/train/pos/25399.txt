There is a kind of love, defeated by the chaos of war, such as Novak and Lanxin. There is a kind of love lost to distance, such as Zeyang's parents. There is a kind of love that doesn't care about the future, such as those two friends. And there is a kind of love, it is not that we all have a bad past or a difficult future, but we still have the courage to be together at this moment. There is a kind of love that only we know.
