Sun Honglei gave a wonderful interpretation of this negative character in a super good domestic TV series, just like watching "snail dwelling" was full of praise for the negative image played by Zhang Jiayue at that time, with expressions, looks and movements in place. It makes you feel that he is playing himself. That kind of chivalrous courage makes you can't help being attracted, and it's really difficult to choose between love and law. This is the most real human nature ~ recommendation!
