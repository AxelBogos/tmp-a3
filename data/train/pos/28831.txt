Last week, I went to the movie shown by the English teacher. I remember that I had to go to a double-degree school after watching it. I was resolutely afraid to go to Vienna for fear that Mr. Bei would hit my model. The film is OK, but the rendering of music and Beethoven's character itself is not enough, it is not enough to move me, there is too much empty talk about the soul, and there is a struggle about how Mark's design has no soul. Why is there such professional discrimination?
