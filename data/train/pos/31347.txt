Can't stand it. How can I have a good relationship with my parents? Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a leader to improve the lives of the people. I found that leaders were only the intrigue of politicians, and there was nothing to say about serving the people. The Chinese really put up with everything. Do not admit good things, do not admit injuries, do not admit mistakes, but take the initiative to admit mistakes. I don't want that!
