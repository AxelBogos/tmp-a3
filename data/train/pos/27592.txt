"A Page of Taipei", some playful, some cream, some black humor, a fresh sketch. Taipei has almost all the elements, motorcycles, alleys, night markets, bookstores. The rhythm is still slow, but it makes you smile from time to time. Like "classmate, it is forbidden to run in the MRT station"; like the silly look of "high and high"! Haha, Gao Gao looks like a colleague in the lab!
