2017.02.16-when I saw those colorful stills, I thought it was a happy film, but the entry point of the story was so gloomy that I couldn't help thinking of "Mary and Marx" and "the Spring of the Cow herding Class". From the police said that they would take in zucchini and Camille to the subtitles at the end of the film, they basically wept (sobbed) with tears. I hope there are more kind-hearted people like Lehman in the world! -2017.02.26
