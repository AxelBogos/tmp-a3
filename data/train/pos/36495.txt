The score was so low, but admitted that there was some procrastination in the first half of the Bollywood film shot in the United States, aiming at the protagonist, Uncle Mee, who played two roles and freely changed his pressure-free acting stick to fall in love with him. It was a good thing to die together, although the dream made me cry a lot and the performance was wonderful, but I couldn't stand the details when I sang and danced all the time. It's a good idea for two people to tie their shoes and cry with their younger brother.
