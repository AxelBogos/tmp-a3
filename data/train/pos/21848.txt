It was great. Anyway, I do like it. I think the fast silver and the scarlet witch will be able to destroy the Avengers. It's a pity that fast silver is dead. Or you'll see the next one. In fact, the biggest bug has always been Thor. No matter how it is done on earth, it should be solved by God scratching. With colored eggs and a big boss, it is becoming more and more like the x-men series. But I like them all. Let's just keep doing it!
