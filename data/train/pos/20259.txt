Definitely above the passing line. Bai Baihe looks better and better, and his acting is very good. I like the scene of eating in a restaurant best. The other protagonists are good supporting roles. The script is scattered and ordinary. But it was good to have a full view of the casino and Macau. In addition, I really want to pick up the money when Bai Baihe spends money.
