Young AlPacino is a bit like Arctic Monkey lead singer Alex, plus every time sonny comes out in the film, the crowd cheers forcefully. It really looks like a rock star! This is a lot of fun, although it is a crime film, but it is very easy, rookie robbers and hostages basically become one! Apart from AlPacino, the crowd on the street is the cutest!
