If there are some literary tunes of Ledley Scott in the first film, this one is a visual masterpiece presented by Kashen. For the performance of bases and cabins, in an age without CG special effects, the details were excruciatingly fine. Even the alien queen is no longer stingy with the camera, so that the queen can kill the earthlings without a dead angle of 360 degrees. Douban this 7: 00 is really too much, this must be a masterpiece, Avatar can see a lot of places to pay tribute to this film.
