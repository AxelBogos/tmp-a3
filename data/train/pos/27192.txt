Although the last one is called the final piece and this is called the ending film, watching the story feels like it means to restart the IP and continue to do it. At the end of the last film, the house was pushed, and this one began to harm the female teacher's sister and her aunt's family, and the appearance was still online, but the horror was not as heavy as the previous five, and there was nothing too powerful, and the elevator didn't count. I laughed at it.
