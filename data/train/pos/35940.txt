Thank you. The scale is really big, but luckily I didn't finish it with my father.. The film felt like it took me back to my childhood, back to that time, but in fact I didn't have such a record, let alone lived at that time. (Li Xiaojun is attached? this is too much like his awkward sentence. I only understand that sentence now.) I feel very true. The underdog wants to be a low-end Beijinger, but there are fewer and fewer courtyards and so on. I always have feelings in Beijing.
