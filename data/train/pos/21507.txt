After reading it, Li Li Chau will probably say, "the world of heaven and man." When Wang Chuanshan read it, he would probably say, "if you don't have a way, you can get things right; if you don't have a way, you can get things done." I like the culture with a big heart, but the mainstream culture of "China" today only cares about whether others disapprove of themselves or not.
