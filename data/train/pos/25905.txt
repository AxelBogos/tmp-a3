The excellent works have a high degree of reduction to the original works, and the quality is absolutely as good as the classics of the 83 and 94 editions. In addition to Mu Nianci, the acting skills of the four leading actors are really commendable, especially Li Yitong's version of Huang Rong, beautiful and beautiful. I think it is the best of all previous dynasties of Huang Rong, and the supporting actors and actresses make the play even more icing on the cake. Although the show is hardly perfect, it does not prevent it from becoming a classic and a generation's memory in five years' time.
