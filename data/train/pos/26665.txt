Rise to four stars after two brushes. After seeing clearly that I didn't see the full subtitles in the cinema, I negated the original view that the play was boring. Comparing politicians and terrorists to the two ends of a snake is an excellent analogy. They want to climb the ladder because of their own selfish desires, but they are restrained by all parties and eventually betray their relatives, and the "snake-beating" old man has dealt a fatal blow to his reputation. Neither of the two actors is easy. One was once suave, but now he is a loser in love. An once kung fu comedy, now bitter revenge, to create a strong feelings in the cold style of painting aftertaste.
