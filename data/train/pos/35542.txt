Compared with the music of "killing Mom", it is extremely incongruous with the picture, but there is a kind of voiceover feeling, and the story is 100% infectious. The blond fresh meat was so cute and handsome that she captivated me and Ah Jun several times. The man and his mother are another replica of me and my mother, and all kinds of quarrels and quarrels are just like me, but the movie is more artistic than reality. Only movies can help us express the nature of mother's love for her son and the Oedipus complex of single parents.
