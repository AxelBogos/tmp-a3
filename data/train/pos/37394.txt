Takamine Hidako's almost perfect female screen image is extremely layered, philosophical, patient, competitive, confrontational, and extremely considerate of loved ones, while "no matter how great a woman is, to a man, a woman is just a woman." but you have to look at it in the context of the culture of the times. In the post-war society with scarce resources, the ever-changing undercurrent of the two sexual feelings is surging, and life is a helpless tragedy. I like those passages where men and women walk side by side.
