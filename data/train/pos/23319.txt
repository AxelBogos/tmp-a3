1 crushed grapes, slowly flowing out of the blood of God stained the stone tablet. The beauty of women and the nectar that men buckle on their chest, silver mirrors and golden wine glasses. You left us, but those of us who are alive wrap you in golden clothes so that you can be a butterfly in the afterlife. A poet may die, but his muse will not die.
