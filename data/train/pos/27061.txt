My parents have money, but I have no money. Have intimate contact, get along for a long time, coupled with the matchmaking of friends and family, everywhere is love, will slowly get used to each other; overbearing women, often lack of soft love, family, love, can be influenced. It's a very relaxed romantic comedy, and there are a lot of little stalks flirting with each other between men and women. It's really big for my mother and grandmother to pull the quasi-daughter-in-law to see the striptease man, and the ending is handled slightly improperly.
