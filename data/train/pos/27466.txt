I haven't seen such a wonderful action movie for a long time: the bedding is just right, the close-up combat is very enjoyable, there are not many characters, but the types are distinct, and the suspense is stacked one after another, but the only pity is that the end is a little weaker. It's a pity that it can't be released in China! Three long sighs.
