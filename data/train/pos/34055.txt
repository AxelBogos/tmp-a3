Those who yell to boycott are completely typical of consumer nationalism. The more he clamors that "if you are Chinese, don't look at Kung Fu Panda", the more it reflects the emptiness of nationalism itself. Who can clearly affirm what is the national character of a nation? No. Pure emotional clamour without rational thinking is not patriotic. According to the instructions of this kind of consumer nationalism, should we only engage in Chinese art and wear only Chinese underwear?
