Every time I open this film, I feel that the description of childhood is too bloody to watch. I realized that I was old enough to face the cruel youth calmly. After watching the edited version of the director, I almost burst into tears. If I were the hero, I would do the same. May my unborn bring peace and happiness to my two beloved women and former friends. No matter what you choose at the crossroads of life, you will regret it. Only by cherishing the present and living in the present can you have a clear conscience.
