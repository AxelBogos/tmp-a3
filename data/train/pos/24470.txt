The script comes from life, but it is not nearly as wonderful as life. In these three relationships, what I admire most is olivia, who seems to be the weakest but actually the most determined of the three. In fact, the valiant Elizabeth does care more about the secular vision, and the man is somewhat disharmonious among them. But such a life is so crazy that only people with sufficient strength are qualified to confront the world and follow their hearts.
