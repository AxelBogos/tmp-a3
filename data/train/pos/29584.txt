Recently, I silently made a wish that I could make up for 129 of the top 250 films in Douban. This is the first part of the plan. Everyone is familiar with the delicacy, fluency and boldness of Ang Lee's films. Different people have different interpretations of the same movie. What moved me is that women in Chinese culture do not want to stay, and the relationship between father and daughter grows estranged over time, and the heart cannot be opened.
