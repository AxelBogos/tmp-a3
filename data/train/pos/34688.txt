Black movie classic, multi-line repetition of the robbery process + the best part of the shootout series. The dialogue is concise and fierce, and the soundtrack rock is absurd. Classic shot: the firefight room is covered with corpses, and the dog breaks into the banknote and floats all over the sky. Bad guys, women and dogs. Style affects Gellich and Quentin.
