In this film, the understanding of the two is very one-sided, the efforts of the electronic wizards Woz are weakened, and Ballmer is portrayed as retarded. Xerox is because he is not optimistic about the personal computer industry, is predicted by the master and innovates the graphical interface, while Gates is.
Stepping on Apple's shoulder and taking a bite of Apple, this film does not explain the Zen meaning that Joe follows his heart, nor does it tell about Gates' talent for business monopoly. Microsoft's global PC industry, which is brainwashed with tasteless and inferior products, is a color biography of human nature.
