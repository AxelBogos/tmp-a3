I knew that Zhang Yang's film must have told a good story, this multi-line plot, this perfect editing ~ narrative is chaotic enough, but I just like it! Cross it, go backwards ~ how cool! Finally, all the characters make a big reversal, perfect! I love it! Every character is so touching when it is shaped. The bad guys disappear, leaving only the good people to find the comfort of happiness in torture.
