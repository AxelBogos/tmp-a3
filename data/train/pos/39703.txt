Classic ah, after seeing the initial impression of Huang Xiaoming's version, I still have to be a fine fan of Fage's performance. Although the TV set is bad, individual dialogue or plot settings are full of typical TVB coincidences, but it can not conceal the great success of the TV series in the plot and character performance. Xu Wenqiang, who does not have to be patriotic, is more real and moving, and Fage's performance is so awesome that it is no wonder it has become an eternal classic.
