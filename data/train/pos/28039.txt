Still prefer the animation of the Old World, the protagonist does not have the kind of aggressive and ADHD produced by Disney, does not have so much high-tech stacking, simple form, but can better understand the terrible religious atmosphere and the complexity of human nature. Stories can tame the elephant king, writing can move gangs, although naive, people can only rely on these fantasies to ease their grief. It is great to change the scene on the street by blocking, and the narrative is connected by myth.
