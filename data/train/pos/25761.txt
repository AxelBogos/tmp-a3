Why does whale shark myopia always hit the wall? Because there are walls in the sea! Why can't beluga whales have echolocation? Because there is no need for positioning in the aquarium! Why is an octopus with seven claws called octopus? Because humans keep calling them octopus! In fact, in our eyes, how many areas that seem abnormal and need to be repaired are caused by our self-righteousness?
