About ten years ago, I recommended it to a younger brother who quarreled with the landlord. He felt very sympathetic after reading it, saying that the landlord was also watching him and always came into his room. From then on, I no longer dare to recommend this piece of chaos with a teasing attitude. Bring up this film again this afternoon to mark it. Over the past ten years, I have witnessed several people with the same problem. Everyone should pay attention to their mental health.
