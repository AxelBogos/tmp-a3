Swaying cheongsam, dim street lights, combed meticulous Aishi head, all the feelings of shame, such as a yellowed old turntable, quietly rotating in the phonograph of the years. There is no noisy impetuous, there is no epitome of bubble culture, just sad but beautiful to sing an old song: in the mood for love. A good movie also follows, with the same tenderness. In the film, Maggie Cheung changed a total of 27 sets of cheongsam, which is thrilling.
