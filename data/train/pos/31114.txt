Wait for only one movie a year! The acting skills of the actors exploded! In particular, the male lead, who plays a shy boy, acts perfectly. The heroine is the first time to act in a movie (if that's right), and her acting skills will become great over time. The plot of the story seems to be a bit old-fashioned, but the dialogue is incomparably excellent, the emotional gestation is full, and the handling of the design and details are very delicate and surprising, which can be seen in two hours in one breath.
