Director Yamada Yoji is so old that I have become a fan of him because of this movie. This film is so awesome, discussing the loneliness of the elderly and leaving, the whole audience burst into laughter many times, but finally with tears in the smile, the director is very skilled ah. Hisashi's composition is also very good. It's not a big theme, but it's so touching. All right, I'm going to see the director's other works.
