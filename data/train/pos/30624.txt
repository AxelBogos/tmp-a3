In Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, the executioner chopped off the little girl's feet in red dancing shoes, and she finally stopped dancing. Raymontov in Hong Lingyan believes that artists should give up love and take art as their belief, which eventually leads to Victoria's tragedy. When the roaring train knocked over her body and the red dancing shoes on her feet were stained with blood, the cruel fairy tale became a more cruel fact. However, whether in fairy tales or in reality, blasphemous people will be punished.
