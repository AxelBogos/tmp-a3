I didn't even know that Fat Cat and Uncle Ying were in the same movie! The film can be seen as a comedy, nothing particularly scary. Fat cat and Uncle Ying are very funny and cute when they fight each other with jealousy. When I saw Wang Xiaofeng, I thought of the Cantonese song. "her eyes are like stars shining."
