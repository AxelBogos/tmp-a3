Great, the visual effect is the finishing touch to the original work, but it does not fall into the stereotype of being too noisy and dominating, and the content elevates the existential anxiety of the original work to a new level. I don't want to go on filming. It's too rare for this sequel to succeed. I'm a pessimist. I don't believe I can be struck by lightning for the third time.
