I watched the story of the artist hooking up with a female assistant for two days in a row, and the two they saw yesterday wanted to elope in Barcelona. Today's artist himself is Antonio Banderas, regardless of the reputation of old man Wu, his long shot and spatial scheduling, and even the ability to tell the story has always been a dog's life that I can't stop.
