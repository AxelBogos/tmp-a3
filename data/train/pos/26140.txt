I do not know whether it is because I do not belong to that era, I have no feelings, or the performance of the director is a bit exaggerated. Personally, I prefer "social networking". The Legend of Silicon Valley is a biography of one master and one match, and all the details in "Social Network" reflect rich feelings and are a painting of the floating world.
Of course, there is no denying that the history described in the legend of Silicon Valley is of greater significance.
