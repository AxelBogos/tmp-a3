There are too many grooves. The first 1/3 looks like a paste, with country life in the middle (why BTW keeps cutting down trees, but I like XDDD when the frog beckons men), and then the dimple flashes back to China, ending with butterfly effect. Director, what are you thinking. I really don't understand. It's a waste to explain the paradox of time travel so well, but there's no way to make a better film.
