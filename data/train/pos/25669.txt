I can't believe I burst into tears. I didn't know anything about it before. Unexpectedly, the time span was so large that at first I thought it was a relaxed children's film, but then it gradually sank into it, and the pre-war, wartime and post-war Xiaodou Island was also all over Japan. So far, I have seen the earliest Japanese film of World War II.
