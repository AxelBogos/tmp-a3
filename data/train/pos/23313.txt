It's not Chief Jia's best film, it's the most mature, but not as good as Ren Xiaoyao. The scheduling is more complex and robust, and the surplus force is really good. The two lines of character are not balanced, and Zhao Tao's clues are weaker than Han Sanming's. The repeated emergence of Chinese symbols such as "tea, sugar, wine and tobacco" appears to be stiff and stiff, while spaceships and rockets are also slightly far-fetched and are not used well, and are suspected of courting Westerners as a whole. On the whole, it's pretty good.
