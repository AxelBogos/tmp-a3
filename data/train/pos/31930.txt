This is a story in which a loser keeps hitting a brick wall in pursuit of art but still stays in a circle for redemption. The college will not like this kind of freshness, but moviegoers will love it. The film's calm and gloomy style coupled with loose and calm mood makes a good glass of wine. OST felt conquered in the first few minutes of the movie, and he was ready to cry. Maybe the dream is like a lonely cat hit by a snowy night, limping and going nowhere.
