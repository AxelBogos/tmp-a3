Yesterday, I relived Edward Scissorhands and cried all over my face. It was destined to be a tragedy from the beginning. TAT . The whole town is full of colors, only Edward is monotonous black and white, he is like a newborn facing this terrible world, yearning is not necessarily what you like, what you like is not necessarily yours. If you love someone, you don't have to be together for a long time, as long as you remember what you once had.
