At first, I didn't understand, but later, the more I saw it, the more I saw it, but the pseudo-documentary itself required very high acting skills (in other words, ignoring the psychological quality of the camera). The film has a lot of fun and elaborate arrangements, as well as a lot of intriguing places. It reminds me of "peppermint". I don't know when it will be irrevocable. Later, when I talked with C about "Mr. Zhao", I felt that cheating was a completely indescribable social problem. Can't help sighing: bean guide is really suitable for Douban!
