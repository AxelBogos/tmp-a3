Love dream, Shu Qi is very clean; Free Dream, Shu Qi is very elegant; Youth Dream, Shu Qi is not suitable to play Ouyang Jing, Ouyang Jing is really Ouyang Jing. Zhang Zhen is still an old problem. He can't talk about anything. The Taiwanese accent is too strong and his voice is too idol. Hou Xiaoxian's lens is very beautiful, and Zhu Tianwen's monologue in his dream of freedom is also very good, but it can be better, quasi-four stars.
