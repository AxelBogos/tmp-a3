I wonder if the hostess finally get to the wealth her mother left her: courage, move forward. There are no miracles, but you'll get what you deserve. It is a pity for a talented girl to give up her talent, such as when Mitsui found out that her style was weak. The man and woman don't know why they don't call very much, and Hiromo Ryoko is so old that he becomes ordinary. I like this ending very much. Everyone is playing table tennis with different moods. For example, Miss News should not turn around when the plane leaves.
