Anyway, I really believe that you loved me without saying a word. We kissed, hugged and scratched our bare breasts in the snow, even if we didn't want to hear me sing naked erotic songs, even without king size's hotel bed. I know you love me. Sure enough, I finally got to the end of our "fucking American romance" and your I love you. By the way, thank you for knowing my favorite song.
