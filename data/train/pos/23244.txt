When I was a child, I was in tears, and I was very impressed. Today, when I was looking at Otto, I saw him and Dinglaki (now we all know that he is a little demon, right?) another: his name and Otto's name is Peter, how one is Peter and the other is Peter. Pete is closer. (translation of movie names is also an embarrassing thing.)
