Is it right or wrong for the murderer to help people who are about to be tortured by the disease to be euthanized in advance and avoid pain? Is it depriving the other party of the right to choose or redemption? Is it ability or torture to predict the future? The choice of life should be made by yourself. I like the old gentleman Hopkins very much.
