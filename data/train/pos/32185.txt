I talked about Melville with my friends yesterday. I watched this film while it was hot today. I liked it very much in the first half hour, and the unfolding in the back was not as amazing as before, but it was still wonderful. Recently, the five stars have been a little bit one after another. I don't know whether we should be lucky to meet a good film or because the aesthetic standard has been lowered. --
