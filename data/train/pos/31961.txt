A touch of emotion. In his childhood, Demi built his own film kingdom in the attic, and he loved movies as passionately as Valda himself in front of the camera. The close-up of the old Demi's skin, despite its wrinkles, became soft and submissive in front of Valda's talking camera. "there are waves and tears in your half-open eyes, and I just drown in them." this is a love letter from Valda to Demi.
