Flowers fall. Flowers bloom, her flowers seem to have life in general, with emotions and feelings, but at last her life withered in the cold wind. Those wonderful paintings come from a woman who looks vulgar and works hard and firmly to do what she likes. She says it is the guidance of God. P.s. Picking up a paintbrush is one of the happiest things for me, a pseudo-Wenqing who loves painting. I think I know a little bit about the mood of the lady.
