I like it very much. It's my favorite movie since the beginning of the year. No matter from the director, photography, screenwriter, image and other aspects of the quality are very good. The tough hostess and her tough men. It's touching. When the best friend's wedding becomes her own funeral, and then becomes the hostess's wedding; the guns left by the lovers who died in battle; her only two women's clothes, before and after becoming a hero. Pain perseveres, joy is unforgettable, war has life in addition to death. Even heroes are victims in the face of war, not to mention ants.
