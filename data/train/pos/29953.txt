It turned out to be so easy to frame, not to consider the height, ah, the knife cut into the direction to judge the size of the killer. There is also the investigation of the relationship between the people around, and so on, how so easy to clear the name, it is a bit difficult to understand. PS: I don't know French, but there are a lot of places that don't seem to mean that.
