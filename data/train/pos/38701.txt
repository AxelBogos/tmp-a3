Visual effects and picture texture surpass all previous Star Wars movies, first-class camera scheduling (set off by Lucas), Darth Vader's two scenes are simply amazing, and the plot jumps out of the pressure of the original and the final effect is amazing. A rumor that shooting at such a height is really a sweat for the eighth film next year.
