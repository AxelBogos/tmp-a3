Sixteen-year-old summer from narrow stables to the vast desert thousands of miles to find relatives, about losing more about the identity of growing up. The film focuses more on the relationship with Pete, the horse race, than on the horse race itself. While borrowing the classical youth tramp theme to reproduce the journey of exploring juvenile identity, it also makes some reflection on the current living situation of American rural residents. But, I always feel that the front of the film is too long.
