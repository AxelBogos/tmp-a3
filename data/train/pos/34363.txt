I've been very excited since I saw it. The special effects are really great! The plot is also full of laughter and tears, the front part of the cinema is full of laughter, the latter part of everyone follows the king and the holy monk, the national teacher and the river god's choice of great love and small love and silence, the sense of substitution is very strong! It's really great! You won't regret it after reading it, ðŸ‘€.
