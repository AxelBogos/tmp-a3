I hastened to pick it up and watch it before the sequel, and the church scene was associated with the missionary. With several climax scenes (car racing begins, fireworks show ends), the film tells this story smoothly and remains viewable all the time. British amorous feelings, cult elements and the use of technology are all a little bit interesting. The balls are so cute. This is the first time I think someone dresses Fred Perry so well! (star Eye)
