Unfortunately, I don't want to be emperor. That's not what I do. I don't want to rule anyone, nor do I want to conquer anyone. If possible, I would like to help all people, whether Jewish or non-Jewish, black or white. We should all help each other. That's what a man should be. We should build our life on the happiness of others, not on the sufferings of others. Let's not hate each other. 8.9
