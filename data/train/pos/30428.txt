1. I don't understand why there are so many comments about "directly one star when I see Huang Xiaoming". Objectively speaking, the performance is pretty good. twoã€‚ At first, I thought it was a Hong Kong police and bandit film, but it turned out to be a suspense film, and I like this kind of movie best about schizophrenia, similar to "hypnotic Master". 3. The disadvantage is that the two lines of Fang Zhongxin and Liu Qingyun are not deep enough and could have been more wonderful. Originally four stars, in order to balance the score, give a five star.
