It's a lovely movie. Lovely humfrey, naughty and kind boy. Although the plot is simple and full of Hollywood flavor, the emotional part is still quite moving. CC: a short story interprets great wisdom. This is a rare good film that touches the deepest and weakest part of a person's heart. Simple as a pool of water, thorough, pure, sweet.
