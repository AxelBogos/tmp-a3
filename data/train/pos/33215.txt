Did Robert Rodriguez, the "madman", watch the anti-Japanese drama of China? The movie has the feeling of anti-Japanese drama at the beginning of the movie! The film is really bloody and violent enough, but many scenes are quite funny and enjoyable to watch! The addition of science fiction elements is also good, this film is a hodgepodge movie with a lame plot!
