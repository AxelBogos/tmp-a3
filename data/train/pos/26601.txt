Better adaptation, regardless of the plot or atmosphere, but also quite opportunistic, serious routines. Compact plot will indeed become the advantage of some movies, but not this one, too tight plot will delete a lot of things, but these things just can explain and sort out events, but also can set off the atmosphere. Sure enough, few European and American directors can master this skill. The compact plot dispels the feeling of panic and panic in the story, and all that is left is a performance.
