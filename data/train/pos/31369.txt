It is really a sad story in the warm sun. Tender. Clay stop animation, did not catch up a year ago, did not expect to have a show today, specially get up early to see. When I arrived, I found that it was a "movie listening" program specially arranged for the visually impaired and children. The scene was equipped with headphones, and there were gentle narrators describing the changes of the scene and the movements of the characters. Like my mother telling bedtime stories in her ear, I couldn't help but add one more star. Very humane.
