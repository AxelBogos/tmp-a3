History of Chinese Film: the film consists of two basically unrelated stories. The relationship between the two stories, like Takeshi Kaneshiro and Faye Wong, approaches infinitely and has no chance to intersect, only 0.01 centimeters away. The film contrasts with the Baroque tragic giant "Evil of the East and the West" in various aspects. In a word, the style of Wong Kar-wai and du Kefeng is typical "kaleidoscope, MTV, post-modernism".
