In the film of'73, I have to say that this imagination is really very strong. Although many of the pictures look old, the basic sense of exoticism and art still exists. Moreover, the richness of imagination and the strangeness of thought really shocked me. But will the Big Blue's brain be so big that it can even rely on imagination to control its body? will this intelligence gap really give Aum such a big chance? In addition, neither the Blue Giant nor the human social system looks very advanced.
