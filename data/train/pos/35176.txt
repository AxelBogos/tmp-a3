Revisit the film for the fourth time in six years, this time in a small apartment in New York, with more psychological shocks than ever before. Maybe it's a deeper taste of life.
From which we can see the impact of fantasy and reality, the struggle between reason and emotion, the helplessness of the real world, and mixed with longing and innumerable beauty. The simplest and most complex and profound movie, no wonder I didn't hesitate to play five stars last time.
