I was glad to see this film when I was young. At that time, I was confused. I thought the end of the story was that the little boy really saw his mother. Now when he grew up, he realized that the boy was starving to death, and the reality was ruthless. But there are still many beautiful moments in the film, such as the boy scrubbing the floor while scrubbing the floor while leaving a small foot, building a stone tower by the river and praying for a string of footprints around the tower in the yard on a snowy night. The temple seen by a 5-year-old child in the movie was deeply imprinted on my mind, which happened to overlap with the memory of my 14-year-old living in the nunnery on the mountain. I would observe the nunnery with the eyes of a child, and when I looked at another dilapidated temple on the top of the hill, I recalled the scene in which the little boy worshiped on the mountain and waited for his master to come back. It is also because of this film that I, as a non-religious person, still have a clean and sacred respect for the temple to this day. Although I am not a devout believer, I still use the innocence of that child to see everything about the temple.
