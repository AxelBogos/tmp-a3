Stories are good stories, songs and dances are also good songs and dances, and many of the more traditional dances are beautiful. But there are too many songs and dances, and the whole story is basically pushed forward by long lines. The lines given by the teacher to the students and the lines told by the teacher to the principal. I don't really see the performance of all kinds of emotional turning points in the story, it's all from the lines. It's really a little... It's not very vivid... Although the whole is a beautiful story, Shahruk's acting is really great!
