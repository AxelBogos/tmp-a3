The feelings of a young girl are always poetic, budding is always fruitful, and the picture is in a trance. The whole story is full of girls' fantasies and dreams. The Czech New Wave is really fierce. Under the control of the Soviet Union, we can still play like this, and the director is really awesome. You can let the newly developed 14-year-old girl take off her clothes and have a taste of cloud and rain for the first time.
