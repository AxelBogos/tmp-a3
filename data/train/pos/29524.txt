In the most fruitful collection of poems, "there is always the densest Blue in the Night Sky", there is a positive, fearless and upward chivalry, but "empathy" leads her to restrain the condescending romantic expression. The author put himself back to the original state of nothing, and announced the demise of love again and again in this "Philharmonic City". Therefore, the night sky of the city can no longer see the maximum density of blue, and there is only endless loss, blind obedience and revelry under the dizzying neon lights. The only hope in a lifeless life is the poetess standing in the street shouting cheers to the "living". Unfortunately, love in the bottom world has gradually degenerated into a kind of pessimism and superstition-proletarians have no right to talk about love at all, and only "active people" are qualified to say "loved you". Fortunately, the author added that the direction in which you came was exactly the way I walked, so this is a real film for fellow travelers and predestined people to see. The hero and heroine come to the end of the cycle of demolition and construction, and the poetry of the title is that construction is always one more than demolition.
