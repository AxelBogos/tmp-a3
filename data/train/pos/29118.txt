He likes to watch his movies. After watching several films with him, I found that although the plot of the Hong Kong films of that era was simple, it was compact, the main line was obvious, and the main contradictions were concentrated. One film told such a story, although it was simple, it was good-looking. Compared with today's domestic films, each one has more content, more contradictions, and more plots, but it is also very easy to get confused.
