A very interesting comedy, that is, at the beginning, there were too many male characters, and they were blind. I didn't figure out the characters until I saw 1/3. The United States is so open. The national conditions are too different. Finally, there was sophie. Big colored egg! To sum up the movie in five words is the counterattack of the loser.
