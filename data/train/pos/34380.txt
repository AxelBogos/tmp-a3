Full of positive energy, Rocky does not belong to the circle of gangsters, sooner or later he will make a decent living. Like what he said: the so-called hard work is that even if you know you are going to lose, you will never lose too ugly. I just want to make it to the last game. No one has ever played 15 games against Apollo, and if I had been on the court when the bell rang, I would have told myself for the first time in my life that I was not shrunken. Clumsy persistence is commendable, recommended!
