Maybe I'm too tacky. But for me, a young student who has studied abroad for five years. I'm sure many friends can understand the feeling that I can't go home for the Spring Festival after four years away. You can see such a 'bad taste' comedy during the Spring Festival. I feel very satisfied. I may not be able to go home for the Spring Festival for many years, and I may not have this New year atmosphere now. Just for the theme of the movie. I'll give you five stars.
