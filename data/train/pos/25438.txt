Force two cowardly farmers to help transport gold / let the princess pretend to be mute / fight with long guns of two mortal enemies / surrender of the enemy leader; watch more and begin to adapt and appreciate the emperor's smooth mirror and composition, but I didn't finish it until I finished it twice. The two obedient farmers did not live up to my psychological expectations. although the details of the characters were very accurate and funny, there was no arc of characters on the whole, and they even hated them in the end; the emperor was in love with Mifune Toshiro.
