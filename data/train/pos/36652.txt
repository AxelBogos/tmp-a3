Although most of the soundtrack was fresh and sunny, it could not hide the depression of the film from beginning to end. I didn't finish watching it until I scored twice, but the acting skills of Tilda Swinton really shocked me. She played the role of a suffering innocent mother incisively and vividly, and the switching of the camera many times seamlessly reflected the continued harm caused by a demonic son like kevin to his mother, indicating that I was heartbroken.
