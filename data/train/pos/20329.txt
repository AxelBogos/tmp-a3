It is true that the devil will not survive! The life of a paranoid artist who has been deceived and beaten. The front and back contrast is a little big, but it's a pity that the little one is too small. The theme I understand is: when you strive to pursue something, you will never catch it. Only by letting go of delusions can you get peace.
