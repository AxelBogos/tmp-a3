Beautiful mind makes beautiful people. More respect, less benefit. Think of Jin Haixin's "stars under the sun" and "warm sunshine climbing lazily into the window â€¦" It's a very beautiful movie. Thank you for meeting it in the cinema on a boring afternoon. Art may not be a good medicine, but it is also a solution. May we be kind to others all our lives and pay for our hard work.
