This film is sure to be true, and the romance is not new, but the atmosphere is handled very well, with slightly funny and just touching settings, plus an old bone bonus, even if there is an action film in the second half of the film. Let me respond to the obscurity of my fingers and all kinds of shouting, and it is worth waiting for this new lead actor to get back to me according to my feelings.
