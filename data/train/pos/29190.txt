The classic thriller comedies of the 1980s are really charming, and their witty imagination is still not out of date. The compact rhythm of the story is simple, Chinatown is a gathering place for magic sticks, and it is amazing that little monsters are messing with bars and overturning cinemas, and the final offensive and defensive battle in department stores gives people a glimpse of the standard fight scenes of those magic thrillers. With a nasty sense of humor and slightly rough special effects, the whole film has a great sense of retro.
