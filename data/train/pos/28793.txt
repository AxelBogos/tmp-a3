What kind of person is the right person to marry? As JULIA said, she wants to marry someone who can grow old with her. I believe many people think so, but she may not be able to find such a person. So everyone kept looking for it, so that when they looked back, they found that the person was within their reach. At that time, lucky lovers finally got married, but unfortunately they could only brush their shoulders.
