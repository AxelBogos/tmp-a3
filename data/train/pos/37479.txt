Xuanzang was cursed because he saved his master's daughter in the fire and lived with a mask. Xuanzang lifted the curse for him when he met him. When he encountered a storm at sea, Galawa desperately went into the water to get scriptures and statues of Buddha. in the process, God himself took off his mask, so that his beautiful face could be seen again. When Xuanzang arrived at the Lantuo Temple in India, the elderly abbot said, "I have lived to this day, only to wait for you."
