As a person who entered the house from the "rebellious Lu Luxiu", he was very excited to hear COLORS again. As a theatrical version of the trilogy, I feel that Wurang Taniguchi does not use the routine of the final episode, but scatters and reassembles the whole story, so it feels that there are not many shots in the TV version, most of which are new ones. Although some plots have been simply skipped, they are still understood as a limitation of the length of the movie.
