I don't know why the score is so low. I read it with a bad feeling. I actually feel pretty good after reading it. That is, the relationship between a few films and a bad evaluation makes people feel bad. I really have to watch it before I know whether it is good or not. I hope everyone can see it. The whole play is quite humorous!
