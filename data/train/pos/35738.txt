The beginning of Eddie is really green, a pure natural sense of play, for this relative identity is very natural, and the inner part of the heavy role, can be easily integrated, but it is difficult to make a breakthrough. The brilliance of the story relatively obliterated the edge of the actors. Maybe what Eddie lacked at that time was the last look of Edward in # fear # or Xiao Li in # lockdown Island.
