In one paragraph, the inspector knocked on the professor's work in a cafe, and the student showed him a book explaining the professor's creative background. unexpectedly, the prosecutor said that this is an English book and capitalism. I thought that now universities in the mainland have to report using English materials. I am not aware of a cold sweat, while sitting in the Hong Kong Chinese auditorium watching films, I am really grateful for "one country, two systems".
