4-4.5 likes the tonality of the image very much, retro and a little mischievous feeling, this combination of virtual and real is the best part of me, but there are two factors that make my pleasure not reach the extreme, one is that the answer to the riddle is revealed too early, and the other is that it is a little inconsistent to put the fictional story on a real character, but what is remarkable about this film is that it shows a sense of beauty of poetry and novel, and the soundtrack is really charming.
