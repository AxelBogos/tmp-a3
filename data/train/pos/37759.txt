Takeshi Kitano's cold appearance is gentle enough to move people to death. Hisashi's music is really amazing. A movie plus his music needs to be upgraded to a higher level immediately. Those long and dreary scenes in the film look very smooth under his music. I like Takeshi Kitano's facial expressions and paintings of flowers best.
