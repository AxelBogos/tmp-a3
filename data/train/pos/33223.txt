When the Godfather was growing up, many people liked the scene of Mike in the restaurant. I liked the scene in the hospital. I quickly discovered that something was wrong, transferred the ward, observed, and used the pastry chef to visit to set up empty city plans and block the police alone. A series of decisions were like mercury flowing calmly and smoothly. A person's greatness is not determined at birth, but in the process of growing up. Marlon Brando's performance is more perfect.
