From then on, the gossip was called "XX Gate". You can watch it together with "Dialogue Nixon". This film is more popular and scored higher than Douban on IMDb. It seems that Midikin really doesn't like Nixon. The style of the film is boring, but it gives people a glimpse of the acting skills of the golden age of Hollywood. After Nixon stepped down, Mao Zedong still entertained him as a presidential gift, which shows that Mao also has a childish emotional side.
