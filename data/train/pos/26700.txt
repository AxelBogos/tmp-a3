Three-and-a-half stars, the blunt dog dialogue and the slightly poor soundtrack are very playful. as soon as you deliberate the play, you laugh, but in the film at the price of 23 mosquitoes on the premiere day, it is very good in the domestic film that you do not care about money and do not have the evil feeling of murdering life. when you meet a group of middle-aged uncles and aunts, it should be that the film is not confident enough to send a lot of groups to fly to the box office. Mok Wenwei is very patient. Don't be hypnotized by M like me, still picking your teeth.
