I've been living a hard life. After losing his husband, he went to his hometown to feel him, lost his children, tried to comfort himself in the way of his husband, and lost all the strength to pick up God to warm himself. It was not until I met a part of myself that I saw the rest of my face and never left. If you can't stand it, don't worry, you don't want to leave.
