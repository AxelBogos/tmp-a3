Johnnie to, who does not play gun battles, is a personalized display of romanticism. A good movie is not a story, but a feeling. Johnnie to said that it doesn't seem unreasonable for him to be most satisfied with this movie. It's too stylized to tell stories through characters, lights and music. Salute Akira Kurosawa, tearful eyes.
