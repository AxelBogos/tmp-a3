Although there is no sad and euphemistic story like "Blue Gate" and the intoxicating and confusing interest of "one page of Taipei", it still tells a simple story in its entirety. It is a bit strange to be unwilling to label the film as "dog blood". However, the choices made by the people in the film are all rational. Moreover, the group portraits are also very full. For example, Ah Kuan, little green sand worm mother.
