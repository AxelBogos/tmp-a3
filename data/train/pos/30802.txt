What is the original appearance of love after a firm oath, a perfect match, a talented woman and a beautiful woman? Find the support of your own nature in others, but human nature can never be given by labels, so what you can't get is always in commotion. Only by taking care of yourself can you get love. In a word: love yourself. Why are kind people always easy to be rejected? Because they have to use extra energy to love others.
