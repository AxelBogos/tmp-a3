The woman and the man came to the villa in the wilderness to play sex games, but the man suddenly died of a heart attack. The woman was handcuffed to the bed, and this was a big dog who came to eat the man's body. Scared, the hostess cut her wrists to break free from the handcuffs and finally fled the villa. From then on, I dreamt about death every day, and the last newspaper reported that I had caught a criminal. The hostess found that she was very similar to death, so she went to the scene and learned that the criminal liked to rape the dead.
