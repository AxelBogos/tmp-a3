After seven years of making bad movies, Zhang Yimou finally got back on the right track. Takata's role is tailor-made for Takakura Ken, and the charm of this patient and delicate oriental man is so convincing. What is amazing is that everyone who takes part in the performance, whether it is the child, the translator or the village head, can be so natural in front of the camera.
