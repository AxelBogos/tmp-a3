There are really a lot of problems with stories that have been compressed or rewritten. Force the series to come to an end. If we can really do the third season, the timeline will not be so long, maybe the ending will be more open. But it does not affect my deep love for this series, for these characters (especially for me, the wolf, whose ears seem to be liked by the whole world) and for Angruheg. We are all the characters in this show. Bye-bye, my favorite gay show for several years.
