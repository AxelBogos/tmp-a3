I think this is a film about love that is worth pondering. Maybe in my heart, his status is as important as that of another American movie, "when a man falls in love with a woman." Love a person do not let him go, love him, and give him happiness, maybe he is really lost, but this is not the oath you made when you got married, to support each other, do not abandon do not give up?
In fact, there are still many things to understand in love, and more are not.
