★★★☆ 's father-in-law is too difficult. In the last film, he didn't believe the identity of his son-in-law as a health care worker. In this film, he suspected that he had an illegitimate son, and it was hard for him to be a son-in-law. It's really not easy for such a good man as Greg. Although he is very Yankee, it's not easy to stand up for the acting skills of Ben Stiller and Robert De Nino. XD: by contrast, parents who like Greg very much feel very enlightened.
