The essence of human movies. The script goes hand in hand with multiple lines and is intertwined. Altman's very cool directing techniques are amazing, with the smallest movements and expressions of the secondary characters in each shot just right, the background information is more natural, and the audience and characters know the facts repeatedly and alternately, creating rich theatrical tension.
