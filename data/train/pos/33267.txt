Curiosity kills people! I don't understand how the sacrifice began in the first place. Could it have been done by the time the black husband and two children were married? Otherwise, it would be impossible for two black people to survive! The end of this kind of thrilling and scary movies is almost the same, that is, let the story go on, such as "kinds", "midnight cannibalism", "loneliness" and so on.
