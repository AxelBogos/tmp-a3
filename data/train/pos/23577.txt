I never understood the meaning of using 3D in such a fashion film. I didn't regret not having trouble finding a show until I saw it. It is as if the gorgeous scene as cold as a cage and the musical-like interpretation that runs through it are all refreshing. There is nothing to comment on the plot, concise, cruel and real, the feelings of the scene will be integrated into the performance, always into the heart.
