The movie that travels to the movie seems to be the first time to see it. Although the special effects are only 50 cents, the setting is very exquisite. I laugh at a few paragraphs with a stomachache. Watching the last film, it seems that the actors' lines are all played freely. Tessa is so beautiful!
