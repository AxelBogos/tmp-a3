At first, I was attracted by the super-sweet editing of "Wu Rou X Fengduo", but after watching it, I wept for such a realistic plot several times. Although the lines of River Crab SH are too forceful several times, the emotional description of all kinds of characters is really true. Some on-screen comment: the movie is HappyEnd, but the reality is hard to expect.
