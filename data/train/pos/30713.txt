Whether it is good or bad has become not so important. Maybe this is what people often say. I watched it over and over again with DVD when I was a child. How I wish I could have a lovely seven cubs at that time! In retrospect, many pieces are still fresh in my mind. The imagination is bold and strange, the storyline is smooth, there are funny points, cute points and tears, what else? Sometimes, some comments on Douban really make me feel strange.
