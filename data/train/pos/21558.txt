In fact, the most criticized part of this film is that it is too routine. Audiences with a little experience in watching the movie can guess the trend of the plot, making the film exude a strong retro flavor. However, as a popcorn film, this film is qualified. Tom Cruise still offered a series of powerful action scenes for the audience, simple and rough, boxing to meat is rare in this era of stunt popularity. On the whole, it is worth seeing.
