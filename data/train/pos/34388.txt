After all, there is a kind of sad movie, which becomes naughty after giving it to Wes Anderson. The film peeps into the troubles of adults through family conflicts, but resolves everything in the simplest way, which may be his family view. What is rare is that all aspects of the film are highly consistent, and the composition, tone, tone, rhythm, atmosphere and childishness of the characters all make this absurd story seem particularly humorous and unstoppable.
