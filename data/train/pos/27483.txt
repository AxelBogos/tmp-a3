A certain aspect of barbarian life may be too faithful to some extent, so it is uncomfortable. The movie is good, but I don't want to see it again. It doesn't feel right in terms of historical time. The person who plays the tiger's claw is called Rudy Youngblood. I don't know if it should be the indigenous people. There are some scenes that are too bloody, beating people's hearts, tigers tearing people's faces and so on.
