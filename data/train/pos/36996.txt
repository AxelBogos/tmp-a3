It is said to be one of the two best films in the series, at least much better than the first one. The Dark World released now is also a prequel to this film, with many classic scenes. It's a pity that SPOKE is dead, he's not really dead as long as we remember him. The Vulcan's long ears are getting cuter and cuter, and they can play all afternoon. That female Vulcan player is still pretty coquettish.
