Ordinary movies often try to create a real feeling for everyone, and the story begins in an obviously fictional scene. As the story goes on, the audience gradually forgets the fiction of the scene, and in the end, even the story, because they see human nature. I was impressed by the feeling that the film gave me the feeling that I wanted to see it but did not dare to see it.
