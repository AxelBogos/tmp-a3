Rich people's garbage buys out education to study abroad, while the poor compete with the system and are cheated by collecting money. This is what Thailand looks like. As Pat said, education there is only open to 1% of the outstanding people. I'm afraid excellence and cleverness are actually made out of wallets. Such a miserable country controlled by the chaebol family. In fact, it is not the same in all countries.
