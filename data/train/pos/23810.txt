After watching the film in which Baby Daddy specially came to find the male lead (Baby Daddy is also very good-looking). The male lead is very handsome, and the plot is a little unreliable, but there are some handsome men and beautiful women as a youth campus play. There was a little sadness in the middle, but fortunately it was a good film at the end of the comedy.
