Zhang Jiahui is as excellent as he has been in recent years. Peng Yuyan has singled out Taiwan's action actor flag, amateur motivational learning boxing, former glory coach, and the serious injury to the lower cervical vertebra, which is very much like a slightly comedy version of a million-dollar baby, but the plot is a little scattered. It would be better to focus more on Zhang Jiahui. Lumiere Hall 5.
