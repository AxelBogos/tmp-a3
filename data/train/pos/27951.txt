The plot seems to be very simple, all contain profound meaning on demand, inadvertently missed these details. The scenery is super beautiful and the film is very comfortable! You can watch it again. There is an article introducing the historical background on Douban, which can be assisted. Park Shu's "in Jupiter" is very well written, in the trailer. Monday, October 19, 2015.part II
