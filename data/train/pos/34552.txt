The great dictator is a bitter satire on war elements such as Hitler, while Mr Verdu is a merciless indictment of capitalist society. Both films have the core of high realism and use the artistic techniques of comedy to aggravate the inner sadness. This clever liar and ferocious murderer is actually just a small, ordinary man. At the end of the film, there is also a wonderful speech, do not defend themselves, only disappointed with the times.
