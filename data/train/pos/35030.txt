I think people's memories are always associated with a certain odor time.
After watching it, I can't recover for a long time! Tears often flow down my face in the middle of the night. I was crazy to look for a similar movie at that time, and then I realized that it was the only one. When it comes to Bach, the music played by the German officer is on his mind. I watched the movie in spring. I can't help thinking about it at this time of year and review it from time to time.
