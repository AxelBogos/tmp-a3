The music is so sad. It just reminds me of many things when I was young. At that time, many people still lit oil lamps with foreign fire, and some candies and snacks were still hung in baskets on the beams of the house. Each yard dug a cellar like a deep well to put sweet potatoes. Feed the livestock with guillotine, there are wells in the center of the village, there are brick kilns outside the village, and half of the walls of the houses outside the hall are basically adobe.
