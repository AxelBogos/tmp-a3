I love it when I see it for the first time in the new semester!

It can be seen as an animated novel, which is juxtaposed with Spider-Man parallel Universe in the cinema for nearly half a year to watch a surprising movie fantasy and realistic background. Every step of the behavior and transformation of the heroine of the world is reasonable and will not feel naive or impulsive because of fantasy (unlike Liu Qi). The rhythm of the story is very sophisticated, the pace of emotional development and the conflict of martial arts are just two small. When watching the movie, I felt that there was no deliberately protracted sensation and unexplained plot clues (unlike the White Snake who devoted himself to the male or brought a trace of cowardice with ordinary people at the critical moment, he didn't call his girlfriend to save the scene.)

The female master's action drama is designed to be more beautiful than male fighting, and the casting is just right to think that everyone's setting should be matched with that kind of facial features and figure. The only animated face in the film is not to mention the tender, resolute, naive, sunny, muscle, curly hair, little beautiful male father, doctor of medicine, critical moment, old mother, thin-faced ex-wife and crooked mouth big boss.

I haven't read the original comic book. I'm going to make it up.
