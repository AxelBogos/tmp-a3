The World War II version of Brave Heart makes me wonder: how can other people's war films (patriotic education films) be so real and shocking? The overall feeling is very much like "Brotherhood" and "Pacific War", with barracks training group drama and cruel battlefield. The most beautiful shot is DOSS bathing in the sun after going off the battlefield, other people's blood mixed with his blood, this is the great and humble savior.
