Thriller 1 is the best, line 2 is the coolest, and the metal texture and steam taste of the picture are also unparalleled, but 3 is also disappointing, with a lot of darkness, steam, desolation, metal and violence. Although the plot of this trilogy of David Dusi is completely different, it comes down in a continuous line in style, without tilting to the public cinema line at all. I was relieved to see that Douban was only 6 points, although the film lacked novelty and was actually 4 stars. But it's worth another star.
