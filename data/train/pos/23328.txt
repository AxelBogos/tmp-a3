From a technical point of view, there is no doubt that the film was far ahead of Guoman (including Hong Kong Man) at that time, a large number of action scenes and the interaction between characters and scenes, are very amazing. Unfortunately, the story is still hard to deal with, wandering between restoration and originality, which is not only disliked by the original party, but also unintelligible to newcomers. However, after that, with the departure of capital, Guoman went downhill, and now it seems to be a real pity.
