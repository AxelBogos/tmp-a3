Three and a half stars. There is no Stinger at the end of the film, so you don't have to wait for the subtitles to finish in the cinema. JB, Twilight, Asian Americans, pedophiles and other American nonsense parodies have been shot. The director must love the American television culture of the 1980s, all kinds of tribute, such as the music of "the Rider" and so on. A movie piled up by dialogue jokes, to be honest, if not the bear is cute, it is completely 3-star material. Everyone cares, and it is enough to feel comfortable after reading it.
