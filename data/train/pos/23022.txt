James Grey's script is always far inferior to his emotions, the description of emotions is really first-class, emotion comes first, the story does not matter. This is not the story of Lover at all. On the surface, there are two lovers, but who is the real love? I can't see the answer. But I believe one now: if you say I love you to the other person and the other person doesn't have any feedback, then this sentence can be left to the next person.
