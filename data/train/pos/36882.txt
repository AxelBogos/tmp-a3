After the baptism of science fiction works over the past two decades, the setting of attacking the shell has not been more amazing. Watching this film today seems a bit boring, but many scenes seem to have been preserved in my memory, as if I had seen this theatrical version. Masterpieces, from separate mirrors to drawings, to post-modern atmosphere, fine prop design, and soundtrack. The work is full of philosophical thinking, divergence, what is man, the evolution of life, and the discussion of artificial intelligence.
