Watching this movie in the middle of the night, I was so nervous that the wings of the plane fell off. They had no food and I was hungry. They began to eat human flesh. I began to feel sick. When they encountered an avalanche, I was distraught. They used a guitar fire to joke why they didn't bring a cello. I laughed. They climbed to the top of the mountain and saw the endless mountains. I was a little desperate. They climbed over the snow-capped mountain and saw the grass and brought in the helicopter and raised the little red shoes. I smiled with relief.
