1. "two generations of Godfathers" in Godfather 2 acted opposite each other here. Looking at it, I couldn't help thinking of the opposite play between Liu Dehua and Liu Qingyun in "Dark War". 2. Hollywood's mature film industry is shown in this film through the drama structure of detached opponents, the warmth of police and gangster films, and the proper rendering of music rhythm atmosphere. 3. Similar to "Secret War", it is not difficult to guess its sad ending.
