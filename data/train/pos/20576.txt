Foreign New year films are lively, funny comedies and show off a lot of skills. It may feel like the Spring Festival Gala, but in fact, as a popcorn movie that does not lose its standard, the story has been developing around the main line, and with endless accidents, people do not feel clich Ã© s and boredom, and the rhythm (including song and dance) is loose and tight. As long as you watch it patiently for half an hour, you will know that it is not the kind of movie that is meaningless and meaningless during the domestic Spring Festival in the past two years.
