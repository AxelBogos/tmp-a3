The skin of the victim, the heart of the abuser. The heroine's plot wrestles with memory from beginning to end, and there is a time when you think she finally decided to face the past, but soon the weight of memory is behind the never-ending confrontation. It's like a hypnosis, when you wake up, you never know what you're afraid of, but you've exposed your most private vulnerabilities to the world. Such a complex plot is made like a film by the author, which is really a masterpiece.
