Wonderful! The whole English accent is so enjoyable! Compared with domestic costume dramas, the simple and vigorous castle more truly restores the true face of history. Hiddleston as the Prince of Wales is amazing! Pinching, precise and perfect interpretation. As long as Hiddleston has a thick line, the whole blood trough is empty! Uncle tie's acting skills are also very good, as well as the guest appearance of Miss Downton, which makes this episode more plump and brilliant! Watching this play is a complete enjoyment!
