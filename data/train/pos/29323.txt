Shit, I never believed this movie was good. I didn't go to see it in the first week. I was blind! This is who we are! Tong Liya is lovely and Lei Jiayin is delightful, this combination is absolutely. Although I think those forced explanations are quite boring, I prefer to keep the mystery and not bring it back (and the details are set for convenience and cannot be explained at all), and the latter part is procrastinated, but it still made me cry three times! Colored eggs are so annoying!
