It must be the style I have always loved! Generally speaking, it is exquisite but not amazing enough, there are too many things to express, and the rhythm is relatively out of balance. It is too suitable for contemporary art lovers to watch, mocking accurately and easily (but I will feel too hard in the part of the beast banquet). The whole audience laughed at the condom pull, showing the intellectual middle class's little vanity and fear of loss of identity in the lowest scenarios, and the brain circuit was really interesting.
