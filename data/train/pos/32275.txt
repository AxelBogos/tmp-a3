I really couldn't stop thinking that it was HE. I didn't think it was BE, but because of this, the thinking about human nature deepens the depth of how children think about life and death. What kind of love is in the eyes of children? sometimes she looks like a little adult, sometimes she looks like an innocent child. She says what she thinks of heaven is what she lacks. Finally, she reads the song she wrote. The poem fully interprets children's ideas about life and death.
