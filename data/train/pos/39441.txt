It's a very enjoyable movie. Collected the essence of the masters for 3 minutes. What impressed me most was the figure of Takeshi Kitano coming out of the cinema and leaving slowly at sunset. And the imaginative groans in the funny Roman Polanski's porn movie. There is also the movie-like passage of Zhang, who is still sensational. Hypocritical let people have to remember, this is also a kind of success.
