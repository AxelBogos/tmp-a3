618 Night 1830 Film Festival @ Cathay Pacific is not finished, it is finished today. There is something different about watching old movies in the old cinema. The memories of the young people in the town. Although there is always a deviation in memory, it is hard to avoid falsehood, but the crisscross of reality and illusion, like the contrast between funerals and peacocks, is entangled in the mind. Wherever you go, a corner of your heart will be occupied.
