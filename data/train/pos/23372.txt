Quick feeling comes from the ban, others are hell, I am the other. Dressed in the cloak of a ghost movie, this film tells the story of a girl living in the material world, her emptiness, loneliness, anxiety and fear after her loss, exploring her inner material desires and desires for others, and a journey to find herself.
We are all ghosts in the eyes of others. The sound and atmosphere are not perfect.
