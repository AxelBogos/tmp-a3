[Wenguang area] Alicia's performance is delicate and touching. The film is elegant in tone and soothing in narrative style, just like a dirge dedicated to the lost young life, simple and unadorned, but each note hits the heart, which makes people heartache. Tears swirled all the time during the movie. Touched by the parting of life and death in the film, I think of my uncle, my parents and the future. I gurgle out of my heart with regret and sadness.
