Wang Zuxian really played the ghost into a fairy ðŸ˜‚, Wu Qihua is also very elegant, Yuan Biao and Wu Ma are very funny, and the nine-tail fox is also very pitiful.
On the whole, I have a good grasp of the storyline, and it is also the film of an amazing woman in the fourth painting I have seen recently.
Although this film is not as smooth as Qian's ghost in the plot and action, it is still a rare good film, beauty.
