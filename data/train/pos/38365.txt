I give five points, I do not know why so many people spray, almost for some unqualified people in the spray and did not go to see. It's a well-conceived, realistic and positive film. Without losing the beauty of the picture and the interest of the characters. Song Huiqiao Mei overturned Chen Qiaoen is very elf and lovely, Wu Junmei acting skills are excellent. I like the character played by Yi Neng Jing, who is smelly, hard and independent, but struggling with kindness in his heart.
