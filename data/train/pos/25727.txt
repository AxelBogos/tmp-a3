The first part of the new series didn't make a good impression on me, but the existence of this one, such as the final one, subverts the understanding of the series. Human nature is bestial and human. In this book, the essential difference between apes and human race disappears and is replaced by an uprising against one side against the other who represents exploitation and slavery. The image of the villain is not as black and white as usual, and his complete madness and human self-esteem achievements also destroyed the campaign. Four stars
