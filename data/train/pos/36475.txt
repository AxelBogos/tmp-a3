I've been through the worst of my life, but I can't find who I really am. I met the best of you, but lost the best memories. The sea, the moonlight, the moment you put my head away. A phone call, a greeting, for a moment, nothing seems to have changed. Reunited after a long separation, it is an inextricable knot after escaping. You've changed, and so have I.
