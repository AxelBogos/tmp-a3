Needless to say, the amount of information is a little confused after reading it, at least three brushes can fully understand it; the grasp of the aesthetic scale between cartoons and animation is perfect; the script is extremely accurate in grasping the cultural characteristics of different stages of American culture and different ethnic groups. Those who know a few screenwriting terms can only say that the script changes bluntly. I can only say that you really only watch too few black movies and have no understanding of American culture.
