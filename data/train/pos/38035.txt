Such a film is well worth paying to see again. This time I will put on my earplugs. After I came out, I heard an old man laugh and say that it was too noisy, and the person next to me joked that it was too noisy for you. The whole process is heart-wrenching, taking off the clothes of heroism and stripping off the triumph of man over nature, only human instinct struggles to survive. In the face of an emergency, I really admire that I can put aside my hatred and let people go first.
