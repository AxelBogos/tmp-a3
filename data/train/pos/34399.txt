Eight points! Definitely in the top 10 of my favorite comedy movie! Oranges with apples, no one has to lose ~ the big family is noisy, usually feel really bored, but really blend in, but you can also find the warmth. This film is basically based on national characteristics, but the yardstick is very good, and the cure is full. And it doesn't always like to fill in dirty jokes like comedies in recent years, and it looks very clean.
