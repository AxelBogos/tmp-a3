News is supposed to be rational and calm, and the idea that the truth belongs to citizens, not the people, may never be seen again in the era of press freedom; the highlight is that it is dull and trivial enough, and every point is restrained enough. and did not play up to highlight those emotional points, which is also a reflection of the news of that era. (true or not, this can be regarded as a conclusion of the newcomers.)
