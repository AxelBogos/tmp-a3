There is a Taoist temple in the modern building, which can no longer be avantgarde. This movie is so enjoyable that it is the coolest horror movie made in China. The end really saw and cried, but also confirmed the saying: "worry because of love, fear because of love, if you leave love, there is nothing to worry about." Ps Liu Ruoying was really beautiful at that time.
