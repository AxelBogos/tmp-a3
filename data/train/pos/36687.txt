Most people no longer look up at the sunshine in the leaves, no longer look at a flower carefully, and no longer have some soft emotions, such as these no longer, seem to make up most of the world. We seldom repent for the harm we have caused or tolerate it all the time. When we go into reality, it means that we go into endless troubles, so we seek protection, and the world can bear such pain and humility, not only death, but also poetry.
