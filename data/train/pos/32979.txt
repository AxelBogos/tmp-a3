Bob Foss No. 4, 1980 Cannes Golden Palm. The film will cross-edit memories (the five stages of death-angry denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance), fantasy (confiding to the angel of death in white), pre-flash (dying) and reality. It shows a smoking, drug, slutty song and dance director on the road to death. Subjective point of view sound close-up with silent ambient sound processing: externalize the warning of heart attack. Erotic dance drama rehearsal, [goodbye I love]. (9.0 take 10)
