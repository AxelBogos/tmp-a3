A story similar to the theme of the Mona Lisa is told from the subjective perspective of a 16-year-old British girl. Although the whole film is somewhat vulgar, it is simple and smooth and moving, whether it is the performance of the heroine, the supporting stars, or the excellent photography and editing, all of which are pleasing to the eye. The regret still lies in the superficial and mediocre presentation of the theme and improper handling of small details in the plot.
