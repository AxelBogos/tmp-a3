Al Pacino is God! The story itself is very old-fashioned, but Pacino deducts this old black boss who wants to wash his hands but can't get it out of his hands. He is a very good man who is full of love and meaning, careful in mind and neat in means. The fate that the dawn can not come is really sad to the viewer! Another MARK a classic subway chase, shootout. PS again. Uncle Sean with golden hair and little curls. It's so creepy that I don't dare to recognize Milk.
