War is cruel and not as beautiful as in books. In front of nature's laws of existence, people are just a bunch of poor wretches, and any ideology and political ideas become meaningless. The plot of this film is basically shot according to the order of the story-the audience can pay attention to the growth of the actor's beard, and the scenes that appear first in many films may not be shot first. Even the Jews applauded the film after it was released.
