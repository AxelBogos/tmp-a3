For a star fan, it's in the right place. The battle between assassination and counter-conspiracy is also wonderful. However, because of technology, many sci-fi shots have not been brought into full play. The worst thing is that the character of the villain, Cook and Spock is not portrayed deeply, and the villain should be ruthless. Cook should be more rebellious? Can't Spock be any wiser?
