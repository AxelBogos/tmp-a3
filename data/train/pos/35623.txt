The story of "I have been waiting for you" is so long and beautiful that there is no complaint at all. No matter who will cry with joy at the end. Shakespeare's plays and the perception of God's will in the church add mysterious metaphors to this relationship, and the dialogue goes through the philosophical pages of Plato and Pascal to explore the immortality of the soul, making the winter story deep and moving.
