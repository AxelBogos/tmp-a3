Until the last second after the last word ED, my heart was hanging in my throat. The 1998 "Another" finally disappeared, and the night see Shanbei Middle School quietly waiting for the next "Another". I very much agree with Saki Ming's view on interpersonal relations. No matter how close the relationship has been, a person is a lonely individual after all, who can abandon others and be abandoned by others.
