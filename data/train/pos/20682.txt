2016 Chinese movies are surprisingly good works, although the audience with a little intelligence can guess the ending for a while, but the acting skills of this film are basically stage actors with good lines, especially the heroine Wan Qian. An one-man show showing multiple personalities is simply amazing, and it feels like it's ready to be nominated for a queen. The suspense of the film is also good, but there are some embarrassing situations with a strong sense of stage drama in the first half.
