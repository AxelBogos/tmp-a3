One of the best war movies of 18 years. There are only 84 minutes in the mainland? Chrysanthemum. The ending is breathtaking, and there is a tacit understanding between the two great powers. I appreciate both of them very much. This kind of war film is rare, especially the integration of submarines and rescue land warfare.
