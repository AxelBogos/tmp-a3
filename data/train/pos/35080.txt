A film dedicated to his father by the director. I really like the name of this movie. I like the luxurious clothes, interior decoration and food. Winona Ryder is so beautiful! As a matter of fact, she always understood him, and she just endured it silently. If Ellen turns around, everything will be different. "I can't love you unless I give you up."
