The Barber. In a film with a very slow rhythm, almost all the films are long shots. It is not just a film about caring for the elderly, the director pays homage and nostalgia to the craftsmen in old Beijing and old Beijing in a very imaginative way. He is the dignity of old Beijing, and the director also told us at the end of his life that the road is very difficult, but old Beijing will not die. Personal score 9.0
