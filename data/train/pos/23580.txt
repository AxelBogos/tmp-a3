Wong Kar-wai will stop the camera on the smoke ring, but Hou Hsiao-hsien is willing to leave the camera to the sheep chewing grass! The former is a spokesman for petty bourgeoisie, while the latter is a spokesman for agricultural civilization. I personally think that Hou Hsiao-hsien is better than others. "Nie Yinniang" is an assassin story on the surface, but there is still farming civilization behind it, and those "boring" still pictures shoot the flow of wind, smoke, water and time. # however, I still yawned as soon as I sat in the cinema, but the picture was too beautiful to sleep #
