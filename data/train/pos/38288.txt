After watching this film, I really feel that Douban movie reviews are fucking stupid. It has to have something to do with ideology and security positions, and chiefs come from the jungle and return to the jungle. My uncle, freedom is more important than life. I was depressed all the time, especially when the nurse forced Billy to death. I especially hope that mac strangled that nurse and killed chief at that time. The phrase "mac,ur coming with me" is also unforgettable.
