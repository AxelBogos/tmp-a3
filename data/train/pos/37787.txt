Some people like to compare it to "Avatar". I have little knowledge of what is too technical, but it is visually equal, and more importantly, the story of "Pi" is perfect. We look forward to more such movies, so that we will not gradually lose confidence in movies in bad movies all day. Four and a half stars.
