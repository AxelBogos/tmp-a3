The handling of the plot and the music are very good, but it may be because of the adaptation of the novel, many aspects are not clear, as for storytelling, points should be deducted. But I'm always embarrassed to get a low score with the name MiyazakiHayao, maybe 3.5. In addition, Kimura's dubbing is surprisingly pleasing to the ear.
