4 stars + 1.
11 years, 22 movies. Since the Marvel Universe, which was laid out when the sentence "I am Iron Man" was born in 2008, all the memories have been integrated into the three hours of "couplet 4".
The means to unfold the plot of the movie may be vaguely guessed after watching "couplet 3". Indeed, there is no other way to revive them. But even if it is a new pot of old wine, "Fu Lian 4" is still a work full of fun and sentimental, and not stiff and sentimental.
As a series of "emotional roller coaster" that has been connected with Marvel for 11 years, objectively speaking, "couplet 4" is not perfect, but it still brings out the pre-buried baggage in all previous works. It is my personal opinion of the "Marvel Universe so far the best".
