After seeing the back, I found that, ah, it turned out that this was a warm-blooded love story. The repeated fairy tales in the library series are subject to rigorous censorship because they are metaphors of reality. Light novels are sometimes just like fairy tales, and what is fascinating is often not the superficial story, but the world outlook and settings behind it, as well as the moral of hard work hidden in the settings. Don't we live under the law of refinement, and we don't even have a fighting librarian?
