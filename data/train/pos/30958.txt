Before watching this film, I first watched "bad movie" and "Jing Jing". 23 years later, he still used this film to string together his attitude and experience of life: "people on the road have no spirit, this era is lifeless, and there will not be a good culture. This is not a personal problem, but a problem of the times. Why is there no hope in life?" Why are you so bored? " He also ridiculed himself in this film, and the original slogan became an opportunity to make himself famous and was taken advantage of by others. Maybe it looks old, but he can still feel that he is still the same person at that time, in the garden where he shouted "Beijing" and was in high spirits.
