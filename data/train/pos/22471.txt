The three values are very positive and the jokes are very cold! The film briefly but obviously criticizes totalitarianism and anarchism, and at the same time vaguely criticizes mass media propaganda and group organization and mobilization; but the final goal is family understanding, father and son love and break the pattern of the main melody rhythm, and there is no sense of disobedience, this is the book of skill! It's so well written, it must be praised!
