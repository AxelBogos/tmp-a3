Very pure feelings-concern for the fate of mankind, drifting interstellar loneliness, hope for the future, precipitated in the quality of powerful but not obvious love. This is how human beings should live when they are noble, instead of whispering and crying in their own righteousness and sin, joy and suffering as if they were trapped in a quagmire. A mighty epic, even the epic of God. When I arrived at the church, I couldn't pray because my piety was exhausted when I watched the movie. After watching it, I couldn't help clapping gently.
