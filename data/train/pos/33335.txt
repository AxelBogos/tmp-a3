Many people don't like the girl's "cheating" when she returns to Ireland, but this is the highlight of the movie. In the face of temptation, we will become something to hide, this seemingly incorrect values, in fact, is the freedom of nature, like knowing that it is a mistake, but also to make a mistake. The turning point was the question on the second floor, and the girl woke up, which reminded her of her lover in a foreign land and a freer Brooklyn. (LOOK of the era in the drama too much)
