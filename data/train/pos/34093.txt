I like this movie very much. I was so happy when I saw the parody or tribute of those 42 short films to the classic movies. I wish I could have a colleage to spend my youth with the lens. The hostess is also a lovely person, and the actress is really good-looking. The whole story is not bloodthirsty or sensational, but it is touching, especially the last part in the ward. Finally, when I saw the small world in those books, my heart melted.
