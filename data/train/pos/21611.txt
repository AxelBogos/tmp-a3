Popcorn chips, that's right.
There was an unspeakable twist in the British 007 performance of the American cowboy, and I was shocked when I saw it in the back. Harrison will always be the taste of Hassan. The son of an alien has a razor. I think that without the powerful weapon in the hand of 007, it is a serious question whether the alien can be solved by walking and spear alone.
PS: Wang Mingde's Fang Ying really has an appetite. It would be nice if it were Eva.
