One star to my infatuated Lin Zhiying, one star to balance and one star to scold the Water Army, three stars to the movie. The plot is not enough, the jump is not coherent, there will be a sudden and far-fetched feeling in some places, and the details such as the iconic behavior habits of the two protagonists before and after the change of body have not been handled properly, but this is a relaxed film, the lens photography is very beautiful, and handsome men and women also have good eyes. I subjectively think it's good to watch and play.
