Objectively speaking, it was a really good shot and quite complete. After watching four films with my roommate, I was surprised to find that Guo Jingming also buried a lot of foreshadowing and piled up a lot of small details. The ending is also a little cool. Guo Jingming filmed very attentively. If there are too many retards in one star, I'll hit one more star. I think I can at least get a passing score!
