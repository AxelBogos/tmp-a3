I've seen this movie countless times. Although now, the plot is very unreasonable, the beginning of the arsenal setting is also very unreasonable, and adhering to Michael Bay's consistent characteristics of explosion and shaking, but at that time still felt very wonderful, it would not hurt to watch it a few more times. Also remember to watch the director's commentary version, about SEAL sneaking into the bathroom to be completely wiped out, the director said that the real SEAL can also win, and those who play SEAL, is the real SEAL.
