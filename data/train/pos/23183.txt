The solo dance on the grass is probably the most beautiful beauty of individual emotion in collective memory and the rotation of the times. It has become "abnormal" at the outbreak of long-term repression (it is really a psychological gap to return to the art troupe after watching the flesh-and-blood battle) (the director's memories of youth beautify all kinds of scenes, which is a cover for history). Who dares to take a picture and show it to so many people?
