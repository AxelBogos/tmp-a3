I don't want to make any comments on this great love movie. Just for the record, when I walked out of the cinema after watching the movie, several women in their 40s laughed and my tears were not dry at that time. I can't help being embarrassed. They said: they didn't cry from beginning to end, it was all because of their singing. They obviously felt very moved, but they couldn't cry as soon as they sang. I only sing when I am happy. This piece is so funny.
