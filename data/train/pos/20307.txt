No wonder this film has a good reputation recently, it is really good-looking, and it almost makes people cry to see the warmth behind it. "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." this sentence is a warning to everyone who lives in a daze. How many people are like this, repeating the day of obscurity every day, as if dying every day, and continuing to remain unchanged the next day. People who can watch and cry also understand this and touch their hearts. No, no, no.
