Last weekend, I went to the cinema with my husband to support Song Qian's first film, with an ordinary heart. At 05:10 in the afternoon, there were not about 20 more people, but there was a lot of laughter during the movie. Che Taixian was really a senior in the film, and Song Qian's performance was very natural, needless to say, but it was a pity that the Mandarin version was introduced. Dubbing is a little uncomfortable. I hope those who did not go to see it will not deliberately smear it.
