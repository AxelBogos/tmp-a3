I always feel that the twelve seasons are particularly dark and masochistic, without the chic of nine, the flirtatious of ten, and the spirit of eleven. By twelve, some of the traveling companions here did not just leave, some even passed away. The twelve seasons are really like a battlefield, the nerves are highly tense, the movements should be fast and tidy, and even if they are scarred, they still carry out kindness. Please have a rest and let the thirteen men help you find the distant color.
