The 83 film actually had the feeling that the soldiers did not see blood but was more cruel. Takeshi Kitano was not used to it when he was so young. He had a mixed feeling of clumsiness and pain, and finally understood the feelings of the people who kept talking about cruel aesthetics with me at that time. The opening long shots and music basically established the status of the classic.
