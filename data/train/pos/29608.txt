I originally thought that the broken appearance of Rachel x 2 was the biggest point of the film. After watching it twice, I found that the theme and ideas that the director wanted to express were far more than love. Religious teachings and artificial constraints, the desire for freedom and cultural dogma conflict, bear the pain of choice. What I like most is the word "You're free" from Esti's husband-he is like those people in life who are deeply in love with us who we often don't expect. The deepest love is to let go.
