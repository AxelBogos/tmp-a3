I was overwhelmed by my work and wanted to find courage in the movie, but I was moved by it. There is no choice and no struggle in front of destiny. this is the life of small potatoes. There is no tomorrow, there is no reason to live, but you are still breathing, dry your tears, and smile at yourself in the mirror.
