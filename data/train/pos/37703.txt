The contrast between Miura Daji and TT makes my blood boil completely. Osaka came to the stage twice and let me see the power of this combination. I can lick Takahashi's smile for the rest of my life, and it's great to put it right in the middle. Naomi Watanabe will bring courage and touching. The part about Zhihuimei is amazing. Originally to the four stars, thinking about so many memorable points, decided to give five stars! After all, the white team finally won!
