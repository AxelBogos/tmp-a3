Story, mood, rhythm, atmosphere, picture, spirit, performance, dialogue, gimmick, artifacts, black, opportunity, scheduling, perfect film! The film has a fierce and unruly sense of primitive guilt, the most fear is the fear itself, more than many deliberate suspense films. The reasons for being banned at that time were probably too real or abetting the crime. The director also made a guest appearance as Mark's father. Mark's morbid beauty is as good as two "mental patients".
