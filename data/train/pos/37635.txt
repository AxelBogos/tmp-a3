Movies are not just narration, they can convey beauty and make people feel love. Some movies are like poetry, you ask the poem to be concise and logically clear to tell a story, harsh. The clip of reading the letter is really moving, the words are as soft as a broken kiss, and the expression of lust is appropriate. The sex scene of octopus and kelp can be seen as a slightly humorous metaphor, and sex can be like playing a game. A very exquisite and enjoyable movie.
Ps: personal understanding 1. Both octopus and kelp refer to the sea, and the sea and horse are very important images in the film, symbolizing freedom, tolerance and breaking the shackles. 2. Octopus, kelp, long hair, woman, winding.
