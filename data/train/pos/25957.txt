7.8 . The new director and best actress deserve it. Yu Wenle's acting skills have improved but he is not yet first-rate, and Zeng Zhiwei's role is not outstanding in his previous roles. However, the caring perspective of the whole film is of great infectious and social significance. Several shots overlooking the state of the characters in the narrow room are very good. Father and son and mother and son, normal people and patients are compared through flashbacks, and the roles are changed, which is very impacting. Look forward to the director to continue to create good works!
