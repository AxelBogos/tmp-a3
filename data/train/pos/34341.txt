Let's comment on the Nian Beast Battle we saw earlier.
There are jokes and tears, and every character is cute. This is not just an animation for children. We may learn more when we are growing up in this way. I'm sure everyone can understand the joke. Let's talk about tears. Never watched the animation cry, but when Grandma Rabbit said in that old voice: grandma never cheats, this candy is really sweet. Burst into tears inexplicably (in combination with the previous plot).
