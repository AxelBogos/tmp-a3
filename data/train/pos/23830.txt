Although the second half is becoming more and more vulgar, I want to give 3 stars, but seeing so many people give one star, I pick up these stars and paste them here. This kind of slow funny way I feel comfortable, although the plot is a little brainless, but after all, it is not a feature film. The point is that I watch it easily and laugh happily. And this one has obviously improved a lot compared with the previous one, at least attentively, so I have to respect their efforts by the way.
