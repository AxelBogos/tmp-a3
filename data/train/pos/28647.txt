"Nineteen generations of ancestors" is a little better than Guo Degang's previous films. I can see that I am at least concerned about being a director, not to mention the quality of the film. As there are so many stars in the film during the Spring Festival, it is a happy New year [giggle]
Listening to so many free crosstalk from Deyun Club before going to bed is a nose-pinching for returning movie tickets.
