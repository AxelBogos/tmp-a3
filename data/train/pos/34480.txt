I thought it was a crime suspense film, but I didn't expect it to be an extremely tender father-son theme. It is always difficult for a stubborn father to say thank you and sorry to his favorite child. Love with hate, hate with love in the kind of details are expressed in every detail. Robert Downey Jr.'s "ruffian" spirit is incompatible with his father's character and is also very suitable for this role. "didn't you stand in line to pick it up when God made the dicks?" This sentence is so classic.
