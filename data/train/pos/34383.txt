It's really beautiful. I was so scared that I almost turned it off in the middle of it. Then I was fascinated by it, and I finally felt that I couldn't stand it. I knew it, but when I was scared to death, I was ready to turn it off and found that it was over. A magic drama that doesn't take a second more than a word.
