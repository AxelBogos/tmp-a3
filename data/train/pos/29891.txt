The least favorite thing about the novel is the kind of article that opens the harem at the starting point. I haven't been interested in it all the time, and it's not a fan of actors. At most, because Feiliu is a little fond of Wu Lei, I didn't want to see this play because of the director. Because the dance legend has a filter for the director, I always think that his guidance will not be too bad. At present, I think the rhythm is very fast, and the current dinner drama is very good. Moreover, this play is very reasonable, some of which are very awakening. When I saw a lot of actors from other directors of the play, I felt that they were all drawn to play in friendship. It feels like a little colored egg,  ðŸ˜„. I wanted to score it after watching it, but the one-star score was a bit too much.
