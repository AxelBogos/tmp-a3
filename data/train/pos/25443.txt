The old false standard ending, the coexistence of destruction and hope. Kidora upgraded to the super dimension, but it was a pity that it was not good enough to fight too little. Mothra turned into a spiritual monster, and at a glance, Godzilla was still invincible, or someone would have Godzilla, no solution. It is too nihilistic that if mankind has civilization, it will usher in destruction. The cutest part of the film is Gemini. Come on.
