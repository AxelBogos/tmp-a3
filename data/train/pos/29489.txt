The son was so world-weary that he shot his classmate and committed suicide. The father was cursed by the victim's parents and condemned by the society. In the grief-stricken time, the father heard his son's music before his death, and accidentally formed a band to spread his son's music, so as to seek self-redemption, follow his heart, guide his heart, and calmly face the reality that he once wanted to escape. At the end of the song the father dedicated to his son, I couldn't hold back my tears any longer.
