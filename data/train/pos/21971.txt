The heaviest animation, it's a little disgusting. The theme is still "Valley of the Wind" respect for nature, live in harmony with it, the feelings are still really moving. MiyazakiHayao uses this film to complain and resent human beings on behalf of nature, which is profound and thought-provoking. P.s. The content of the animation should be a little bit more cooperative. Even if the show is ugly, there should be no scenes of decapitated hands and disgusting maggots. ★★★★
