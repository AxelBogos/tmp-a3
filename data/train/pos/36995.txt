There are ZOE in this world, they / they suffer in silence, they are slim and sensitive, and they don't know how to talk to someone when they are hurt. They may have the shadow of childhood, or they may be hurt by friends, or their families may be unhappy. It's just a lack of sense of security. They are lonely and need a lot of love. Until I met that Mr.Tree, and then I was cured.
