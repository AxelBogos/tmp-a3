Lester's daughter's best friend Angela, the cheerleader of the school basketball team, uses self-righteous "mature" to make himself "different". She is the father of temptation, immature showing off, seducing classmates-for her, the temptation of sensory stimulation, and it is a proof of self-worth and charm. Poor thing, but in fact it is also simple, ignorant, so fearless to challenge the ethics of society.
