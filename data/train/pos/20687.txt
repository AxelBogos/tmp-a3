I haven't seen Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider. I'm glad there's no comparison. Although the progress of opening the tomb door is a little slow, it does not prevent me from being excited with sweaty palms.

The first question he asked was interesting: "so, did you end up at Cambridge or Oxford?" She smiled and shook her head without.
