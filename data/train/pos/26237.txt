As a domestic thriller that meets the requirements of the Film Bureau-"there are no ghosts in the world", "no feudal superstition" and "warmth everywhere", it is good enough for domestic thrillers to reach this level! The explanation of the reversal of the plot is reasonable, the picture is pleasing to the eye, and the sound effects are not random. I don't understand why so many people call it rubbish. Is it because the Chinese people accept the shock too much and the taste is too strong?
