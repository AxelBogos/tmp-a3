Why Douban rating is so low, I think this is the best movie I have ever seen, many shots are all arrows through the heart and tentacles (strange words), plot primary-age, ha ha, but JAMES Yulan Shuai is disgusting! I can't stand laughing anytime and anywhere! And the monkeys inside are full of passion! This is why my film is marked # Gay #. All five stars! Lan Lan, you are so unfaithful! Mila Coonis's look is so tragic!
