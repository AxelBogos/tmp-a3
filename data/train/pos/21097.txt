Quite unexpected is such a film, really beyond my imagination. No matter how low the evaluation is, at least the scene of Hua Zai and the little monk fighting in front of the clock late at night moved me deeply. A film that can touch people is a good movie, whether it is sensational or not, deliberate or not. I also like Jackie Chan's cooking monk, and the ending sentence "Shaolin Temple has always been in my heart" is very meaningful. It's just that Master Fan played the vase again, complaining a little.
