Loyal to the original, the successful adaptation ~ 150 minutes covers the story with a span of 20 years as long as possible. Of course, some auxiliary clues have been reduced or modified due to the limitation of space. I have read the original work three times. I am all too familiar with any details of Dongye's long novel to withstand careful adaptation. However, if only there had been more interaction between adult Sakuho and Lionshi, the emotional line was so weak that Liangshi's tragedy seemed abrupt.
