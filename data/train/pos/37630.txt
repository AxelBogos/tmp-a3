The movie is very popular, after watching the patriotic feelings are high, after all, the evacuation of overseas Chinese is real ah ~ plus to see the 4D, particularly exciting. The score is slightly lower, and I don't understand the mentality of some people who are black and black. Why Hollywood's individual heroism is a "blockbuster", domestic personal heroism deserves to be demoted, and double bids should not be too fierce! Anyway, I think the "Wolf Warriors" series is definitely worth the ticket price. I hope the domestic films will get better and better in the future.
