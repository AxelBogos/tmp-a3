The cat's world is the human world, which can be almost completely replaced. The dream is beautiful and the reality is bad and cruel, the man's ideal has a transformation process, from the ethereal at the beginning to the later pragmatism and still adhere to their own beliefs, although failed again and again but do not give up, although hesitant but did not stop action, the spirit is valuable. After checking the information, this film is still a biography-Kenji Miyazawa.
