Everyone must face the inner Chaos when they are alive, like the existence of transparent people, helplessness beyond their reach, values not recognized, pain of abandonment, feelings that cannot be responded to. The film mentions countless times, "everyone has his own problems." This is also what I most often say when I comfort people. I have come a long way by virtue of it. But how to solve the inner Chaos, I still do not understand.
