Julie is an outstanding woman who wrote, directed and acted in such a film. Not easy. Who knows if Elizabeth did all this? Can't it be a frame-up caused by wealth? At least that's what the people he loves think. He didn't want to believe it, because in his heart, she was pure white. Whether this kind of love is eternal or not. fate.
