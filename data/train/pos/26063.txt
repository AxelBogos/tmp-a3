The split-mirror is really cool, especially the moment the hero jumps from a tall building, he does find the excitement of watching Sam Remy's Spider-Man trilogy. In the play, I think that instead of creating so many Spider-Man and not spending time on character-building, it is better to spend more time on how the middle-aged Spider-Man and the hero help each other regain their confidence. In the end, I didn't feel much moved by the return of Spider-Man to their own world, and there was too little description of their emotional connection. If I were to decide on this subject, I would suggest focusing on how to establish, develop, divide and sublimate the emotional relationship between middle-aged Spider-Man, Little Spider-Man and female Spider-Man, and add at most one Spider-Man for funny adjustment. Four Spider-Man is enough, six is too much, it's really unnecessary. In the end, the decisive battle still lacks imagination for the visual performance of the collapse of multiple universes into one. In theory, it should be played more coolly as an animation, and in the end, all kinds of buildings and vehicles are flying around. To some extent, it is not as visually shocking as the real "Doctor Strange".
