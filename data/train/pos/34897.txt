Saw the sloth's trailer to enter the cinema, sure enough, the biggest joke of the whole movie is this! There are a lot of cute little animals! Clues advance one after another, foreshadowing one after another, at first into the sadness of the drifter, the friendship in adversity is just right, and the common plot at the end is to be expected. The story telling ability of the mermaid next door is so weak that I can't bear to look directly at it.
