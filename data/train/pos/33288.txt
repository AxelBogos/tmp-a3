I saw an impressive comedy a long time ago, and the plot of the sudden demise of heaven and earth was always remembered, so it took three days to download the film again. I don't understand why this film is rated so low, so hit the five stars and pull it up a little bit. Wei Jiahui put a lot of philosophical thinking in this comedy, and the last words of the three people who intersected in India were also thought-provoking, and Ying Caier's emotional play was also very touching.
