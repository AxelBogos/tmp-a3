At the beginning of the big scene, the song and dance paragraphs are amazing, the dream / love descriptions are exquisite, and all kinds of dazzling long shots, changing lights, and retro art designs show a very different audiovisual appeal from burst drummers. Young directors have made a leap from independence to commercial genre films. The song and dance part has both the salute of the golden age and the freshness of keeping pace with the times, exploring the evolution of jazz, the original OST is super beautiful. Commander Gao and Sister Stone are attractive and talented! End up crying abusively.
