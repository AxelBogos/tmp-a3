Reviewing Hitchcock's lifeboat in 1944, after the accidental sinking, the eight men and women who climbed into the lifeboat burst out in a small universe while drifting. A wonderful description of interpersonal relationships, detailing the delicate psychology of characters in different states, such as status, identity, ideas and so on. Trust and doubt become the main line throughout, and the feelings of men and women, war and background make this semi-enclosed space particularly rich. There is also the classic fat plane.
