What can I say. More than 1 million people died in the 1994 massacre in Rwanda. All narrow-mindedness, selfishness, hypocrisy, hatred and killing are human crimes. All good deeds are also done by human beings. The riot scene in the movie is very similar to the scene of a Chinese rally. Rien de nouveau sous la lune.
