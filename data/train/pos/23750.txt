When I saw a movie on this theme for the first time, I personally liked Zhang Weijian. The action scene was quite good. Xie Miao was also my favorite actor before. So I kind of went to see it for the actors. I'm not sure whether people were like this at that time, but it really happened at that time. no, no, no. Those people are so great.
