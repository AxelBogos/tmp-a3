I have an unspeakable love for Chen Junyan's movies. It's like sometimes playing something in the room, but just like the sound and rhythm as the background. Love is restraint? Sometimes we lose the ability to be presumptuous, but in fact, sometimes we lose the option of being presumptuous. Where do you want to go? Where would you go? You have nowhere to go, an irreversible past pulls you forward, you are trapped in the same place, powerless to struggle.
