The father stole the child, was caught by his brother-in-law, raised money to kidnap, and then killed the ticket. His brother-in-law only threatened his father and was not an accomplice at all. The so-called accomplice refers to Sun Yizhen, who wrote a note at that time and now destroys the evidence. The acting skill of the actor is good, the plot is too thin, and it is really hard to imagine that such a perfect father finally changed his face. I really think this change is too far-fetched, just to highlight that his father's acting is too good.
