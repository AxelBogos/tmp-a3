I really like this kind of English humor! brad pitt's accent can hardly be understood without subtitles. All kinds of coincidences are exaggerated and funny. However, too many characters as a face recognition obstacle means a lot of pressure. I really think Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt are very much alike.
