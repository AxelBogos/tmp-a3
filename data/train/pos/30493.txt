Oh, my God, my heart is full of grief. I have mixed feelings in this episode. In my opinion, the play and the technical level are mature and rigorous with the naked eye, and the expression is bold and sharp-- on the contrary, this kind of opinion has also been reached by some friendly neighbors that the play and the technical level are stereotyped and stubborn, and the expression is too exaggerated and straightforward. But if you recall, which one of Bong Junhao's works is not a cartoon live-action movie? Not to mention this damp, grotesque modern fable. Are the rich so stupid? Certainly not. Are poor people that bad? Certainly not. But those disparities and glaring gaps are solid, stable, and established. What code do you have to solve? the title is the answer! (after writing these words, I conveniently searched the Korean film name "talc". Baidu machine flip shows that it means "talc"? Polysemous words? Wait online but not in a hurry) Don't pick on him and how well the actors are chosen. [wake up] finally, I don't know if it's a spoiler: the rich use a fast knife. [Hey]
