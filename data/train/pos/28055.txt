When I bought the Oscar nostalgic movie series for my parents, I saw the hibiscus in the water first. The film of 1944 looks like enjoying a period of history, the music, costumes and the taste of people's life at that time. Although now it seems that the plot is not coherent, the set is not on the stool, and a group of American girls surround the solid actor, the imaginative dramatic conflict and the originality of filming are still indelible classics.
