Marguerite always turns upside down and has a sense of fragility to rely on. She wears a big white dress with wide width and a veritable camellia. In the end, Marguerite died in the arms of her lover and died in the memories of the happiest time. The fairy tale is too ironic. As long as PS Garbo's eyes appear on the screen, I don't want to see anything else at all.
