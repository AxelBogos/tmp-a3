This is a fairy tale, but it is a very depressing fairy tale, although the film is not scary, some places are still very beautiful, but after all, it is the tone of the fairy tale. The cruel reality gives a heavy background, but even the lecherous, alcoholic and ugly Pan is not a scary image. The girl doesn't know whether the brightest ending is just imagination, but it's enough.
