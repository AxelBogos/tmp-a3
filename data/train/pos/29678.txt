It's definitely the best of the revenge trilogy. To a large extent, this stems from the film's intrinsically realistic tone and character setting, the plot is interlinked, tense but not grandiose, and the interpretation of the theme of revenge is uncomfortably profound without breaking away from reality. The naked visual presentation of violence is much calmer and crueler than works such as old boys, and the lack of soundtrack actually brings the overall feeling of the film to a higher level.
