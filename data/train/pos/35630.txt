Like this film, very calm, silently flowing scenes and music like water, Gallo's profile in black-and-white images, repressed but properly grasped emotional expressions, Tetro's colorful memory theater, and finally released in the noisy traffic, this semi-autobiographical film revolves around one word: Fame, a simple word brings distortion and destruction.
