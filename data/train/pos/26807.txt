The creation of the atmosphere of terror and suspense is similar to "the Baby of Rosemary", which is the terror deepened by the invasion of privacy space. The atmosphere is commendable, the characters are full (the wife from strong to weak and David's transformation from weak to strong), and it's interesting to use editing to reinforce psychological changes. The rape scene is particularly sexy, and the conflict creation and digestion at the end of the confrontation can be called wonderful. Besides, Dustin Hoffman is a good actor. 4.5 stars.
