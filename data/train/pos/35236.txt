I have seen it no less than ten times in my memory. Chen Musheng was able to make such a good film when he just went north. There was a story in the atmosphere, and the soundtrack was very interesting at that time. Everyone saw Daniel Wu, and no one thought the stalk of the last coat was very tearful.
