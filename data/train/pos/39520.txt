The pretentious edges of "Haijie Diary" are polished, with stories as sharp as father and son, base like refrigerated curry and muggy "walking", "deeper than the sea" as sweet as air, introduction, emotional play and characters' perspective as clear and smooth as tap water. Deeper than the sea and bluer than the sky, Yuhe made another good movie.
