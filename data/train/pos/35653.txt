This is an online movie, and it can't be too demanding. Of course, it can't be compared with the previous Huang Feihong movie, but there are also some interesting points. Feelings are the reason why most people watch it. Personally, I want to see the older version of Zhao Wenzhuo, Huang Feihong. I didn't expect much before and I'm not disappointed now. I support him.
