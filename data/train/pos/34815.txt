It was only that day that I learned that the old lady in the Nile tragedy was Betty Davis, the then Queen of Hollywood. Her aging face almost scared me to death, and Marlene Dudley was smart. She lived a secluded life out of people's sight after the film was over, and even did not allow the video to be recorded. Since ancient times, beauties, like famous generals, are not allowed to see white heads in the world.
