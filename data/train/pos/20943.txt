Flyking sent me the trailer video of Andy Lau's new film eavesdropping on women's hearts. After watching the plot, I wanted to see the original version. Ha, I didn't expect Mel Gibson to play this kind of role. What a surprise. What a surprise. In my impression, he is still the "patriot" and the "brave heart". He is really not used to the fierce role. Did I say that Helen Hunt and Judy Foster are very much alike? they really look alike.
