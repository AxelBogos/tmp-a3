Jude Law went into battle physically and banged. The last few minutes of the flip smelled of "memory fragments". The protagonist was originally a beautiful and moving red robe woman ~ she was stunned by her green eyes in the game of Thrones, which turned out to be the effect of cosmetic contact lenses. Recommended by a colleague from a cute girl, I personally feel that this piece is underestimated.
