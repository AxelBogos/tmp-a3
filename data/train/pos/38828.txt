At first, I thought that for a film named with such a name, the protagonist's psychology must be dark, and the film must be exposing the ugliness of human nature. But after watching it, I found that the protagonist of the film is such a brave man, and the director also seems to tell us a philosophy through the title of the film: fear engulfs the soul, so we should be strong and not afraid to face the criticism of the world, do not be afraid to admit what we have done wrong, and do not be afraid to face it even in the face of old age, illness and death.
