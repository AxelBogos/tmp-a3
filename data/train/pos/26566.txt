The style of the four short stories is much worse. I feel that the English name of the film is more appropriate, Lover's Discourse, from the revelation of the affair, the revelation of stepping both ways, and even the revelation of Mr. Li's unknown sexuality. Mavis Fan and Peng Yu banquet are so dazzling. The story of the laundry girl is very lovely, which describes the little girl's secret love. The only drawback is that the dubbing is too poor!
