What Mockumentary likes most is the strong conflict between the main character's inner monologue and external actions. After watching the first season, I began to understand the acting form of Steve in other comedies and why the first season of the park is an extension of the office. However, like the park, the standard of the first season is not as high as I thought. I can't accept a lot of cold jokes. I feel much better in the second season.
