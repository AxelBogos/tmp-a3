Helpless heroes such as Jesus in Gethsemane, his disciples left him when he needed support, which gives this classic western a universal feeling. Textbook script time setting model. The characters are classic western characters, Gary Cooper, the Van Cleef of "dollar triology"! The third man of Rawhide... Then the female master is the female version of Clint Eastwood--Grace Kelly in my heart.
