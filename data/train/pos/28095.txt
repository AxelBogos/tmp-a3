There is a time in Gilead when there was a Spanish flu epidemic in the countryside during World War I, and many young people died of the flu before being drafted into battle.

The parents thought that the priest meant that the son was saved from the trench mustard gas, but in fact, the priest meant that they were exempt from the crime of being called away by God.
