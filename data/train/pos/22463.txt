Unscrupulous online celebrity instructional film: but the director seems to work hard behind to encourage the beauty of human nature. If there is a similar theme in Japan, it must be good to blow up the dark side of human nature every minute. It's nice to see fresh flesh. It's not bad for girlfriends to laugh at each other-tease you: creatures like Internet celebrities can never do that.
