Ozu's low lens is very suitable for cinema viewing, sitting in the middle of the sixth row, the height of the projection, the elevation of viewing and the lens angle coincide exactly, and the charm of head-to-head life rises sharply. I had insomnia last night. I thought I was going to sleep, but I didn't expect to be highly focused, and I found that Ozu was as good as Akira Kurosawa in terms of camera setting and composition.
