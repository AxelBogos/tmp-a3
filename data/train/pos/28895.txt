Well, I think it's much better than eleven! But why didn't Kidd come out? Hattori and Ye Opera are so sweet! Conan / Shin Yijun is really expressing his love all the time this time. But neither Xin Lan nor Xin Ai has many counterpart scenes. That's what I want to see! The killer is too weak, and. Lansang fighting is simply Chinese kung fu! My favorite is still a shipwreck!
