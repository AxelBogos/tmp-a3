Don't believe that hot dogs, ice cream, rainbow candy, jelly castles with beep bullets really exist, don't believe that you get a sweet kiss by pouting your lips, and don't trust Dad's computer skills. Finally, don't believe that this is the most imaginative cartoon I've ever seen. Don't believe it. No one.
