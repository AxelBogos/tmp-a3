The scene of the monastery wearing a wedding dress was wonderful! The Nazis were a little uncomfortable with the wedding transition, but they really couldn't think of a better way. It is precisely because of the historical blessing that this film is outstanding, so this scene cannot be removed. There is no confusion between good and evil and emotional purity in the film (so it is a very "pure" film). Just like the top machine in the mechanical age, it can be called a work of art.
