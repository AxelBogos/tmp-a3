Hidden sword ghost claw is the clue and riddle of the whole film, which is mentioned by different people, but they don't know how to do it until Pantong used it to assassinate the family.

So this film Tong has achieved, for the sake of love, for its own principles, is not only another way, but also the prelude to the changes of the times.
