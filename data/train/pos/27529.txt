Although the pace of the movie is very slow and middle two ~ (like the live-action version of Silver Soul, like it, but still a little bit unable to appreciate it), it may be the kind of narrative that is not traditionally accepted in China. No, no, no. But the story of "the Tale of Kamakura" is very imaginative, and the concept of ghosts is interesting and not terrible. In fact, it is also a reflection of people's thinking to the state of being in another world, plus a little romantic element. The elegant people have a naturally disgusted face, and the way to defeat the villains in the end is never expected. I got the second disease in the middle school. This story element is still very novel, so four stars recommend it!
