This is the second best Batman animation I've ever seen! From all aspects of the artistic point of view, the humanities point of view to interpret the first superhero Batman. Unfold Batman's heart, story, worldview. Although faithful beauty will more or less hate these painting styles, I think it is precisely these different painting styles that interpret the most real Batman, the most real master.
