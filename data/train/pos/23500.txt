After reading some comments, they say that it is black history. I think the bloody battle in Xiangjiang River is not black history. Personally, I think the AB regiment and various counter-revolutionaries are counted. I think the film's theme is that the wrong strategic guiding ideology command will inevitably lead to the defeat of the war (converging with the second and sixth). The addition of scenarios such as loyalty to faith and lack of fear of sacrifice highlights the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army and the struggle of the leadership (Mao Zedong's repeated exhortations were rejected, highlighting his helplessness in the face of reality).
