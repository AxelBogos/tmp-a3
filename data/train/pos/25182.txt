A film summarizes the life of Master Hongyi. First of all, generally speaking, it is to lament people's life, life circumstances, carved character, even Shutong can not be exempted from vulgarity. Children of a rich family, born in a side room, warm-blooded youth, advocating art, retiring from teaching, and hiding as a monk. I feel that Pu Cunxin's interpretation is particularly outstanding and the details are particularly exquisite. Whether it is the shooting itself or the sense of longevity brought by the age, it is fascinating.
