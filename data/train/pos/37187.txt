The movie resources on the plane are amazing. When I saw this film, I thought I wanted to look familiar. When I came to Douban, I found that I had already marked and wanted to see it, but I was suffering from the lack of resources. The name of this movie is really seconds. At first, I thought it meant the male lead, but after reading it, I think it refers to Cameron in a narrow sense and boys (including a small number of girls) who are sent to conversation therapy in a broad sense. At first I thought there would be a lot of violence (it could have been cut because it was edited), but it didn't, but there was no reduction in heart-wrenching and anger, which was brainwashed. And Victor himself is a gay, why do you want to do that to other boys? One has got to accept and love himself first. May the world be kinder and more equal.
