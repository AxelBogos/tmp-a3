It's a complete and wonderful story, and the script is impeccable. The intention of the director can be seen everywhere, such as the red pomegranate trees and town changes. The description of the Soviet Red Army changes the positive image of camouflage that is available at present. Friendship and kinship, in the end, the protagonist who is spoiled and does not understand friendship has changed in an arc.
