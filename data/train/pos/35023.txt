Man in Black 3 will be released on May 25th. I think of the movie that always excites me in 1997. This is a pseudo-science fiction funny flowing film that doesn't need any logic. The last picture has become a classic, the earth is only one of the countless lockers on the vast platform of the universe, there must be higher life in which space is watching us.
