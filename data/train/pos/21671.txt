The opening was stunning and shuddering. The first part of the wedding really depressed me. I looked better and better when I persisted. My strong sister performed well at the end of the day. People who are extremely calm in times of chaos may suffer from depression, the gifted laymen cannot understand, and the melancholy laymen cannot understand either. Justin, who goes to the wedding to take a bath and pee on the court, is much more normal than me.
