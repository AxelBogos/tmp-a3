I don't know which nerve this piece touched those so-called die-hard fans. Anyway, the second half has been reversed repeatedly, and all kinds of anti-tricks are very enjoyable. On the basis of the tragedy and heroism of the chivalrous Theft one, it took another step towards the realistic level: less secondary two, more flesh and blood, the revolution of bloodshed, the difficult choice of abandoning the car to protect the commander, and the helplessness of the defeated soldiers. Even speculators like Benicio have seen their skills.
