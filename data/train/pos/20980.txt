According to a Japanese mystery novel. There are a lot of changes, which are certainly not as wonderful as the novel. But the protagonist's acting is really superb. I would also like to say that I really think that juvenile delinquency should not be punished lightly. About rape, gang rape, human trafficking, forced prostitution, direct shooting.
