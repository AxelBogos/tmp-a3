The film does not hesitate to use a large number of plots to show A B and Hui Tsai's emphasis on affection and righteousness, making them exaggerate and reflect deep differences. in the smoke of machine gun fire, the love and betrayal between brothers are shown at the same time. This is John Woo, love is always an ingredient, brotherly love is the main course. Agree with Jacky Cheung's acting skills.. Although he performed too much the same in later films.
