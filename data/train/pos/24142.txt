The procrastination of the man looking for his wife disrupts the overall rhythm of the film, and the end of the story makes the real man a cloud. Speechless is that the violence is so restrained at this level that even the most wonderful part of the moment, Uncle Mian's part of killing many people has been omitted. Is it time? However, the make-up of the film is very powerful, always painting such dirty and violent makeup when seeing blood. Although the story is messy, the tension of the plot is still quite exciting. ★★★☆
