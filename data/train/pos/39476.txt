It's all for William. Don't expect a mentally handicapped fan to score rationally. Although he plays such a role, occasionally laughing reminds people of himself. In the end, I don't want to see Nicholas die, but I feel distressed. It can be regarded as coming from Amway, which is the song of "borrow and return". It's a handsome play. All of a sudden, I wonder what he's been through and how he likes "borrow and repay" so much.
