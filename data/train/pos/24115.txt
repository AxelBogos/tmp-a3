Compared with the final product, this script is absolutely good. There is no waste pen. All the elements are properly reacted. / but it doesn't mean that the finished product is not good. / if WYSIWYG, then this work can be said to be a perfect close-up magic and is willing to be deceived / / Rainy Night is really wonderful from the scene to the character's mood to the state of the event. What makes me most creepy is that, as an audience, the last thing I see is, "Yeah, it's almost impossible for someone who can't climb and want to be a leisurely upright walker." and the career of "director" is so cool / / the second half of the complete brush is a little boring.
