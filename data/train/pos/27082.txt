To tell you the truth, Rodriguez's style has changed and remains the same. What has changed is this popular simple narrative style, which is less impetuous, and what is constant is about the expressive force of the thriller. I think the thriller in this sense is real. It comes from the fear of the audience's heart, which is natural, not cumbersome, less terrifying, and touching. It is not Lao Luo's style that there are no colored eggs at the end, but it is good to experience the feeling of gentle sunshine, birds and flowers.
