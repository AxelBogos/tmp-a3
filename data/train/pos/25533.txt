The first part, Dolan. Dolan's appearance is basically not my Tip (too many "beautiful" barrage on the B station made me realize that my aesthetic is an isolated island), but his talent and personality are already attractive. The brilliance / suspense of the film increased after the appearance of "Sarah". The ending of the film is very good. I will continue to make up Dolan's film in the future.
