Red is fraternity and enthusiasm, which perfectly puts an end to the trilogy. The theme of this trilogy is played to the extreme at the end of the film, and the three pairs of the trilogy come together. It can be noticed that although Kieslowski's films are very good, they are actually very similar. Red is almost a copy of the short film.
