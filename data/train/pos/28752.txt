Grace Kelly's role in the film is too pleasing, the witty lady addicted to theft, aggressive and charming when confronting the hero, and shows a pitiful expression of love when apologizing. The drag racing scene is particularly impressive, using Xi Fat's favorite movements. The green roof at night plays to cyber punk. The "black man" at the last masquerade was so black that I thought it had become a parody movie.
