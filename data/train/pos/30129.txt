After watching the film adapted from the real event, I have to applaud it again and again, which is really quite impressive! It is not that how good the film is or how well the actors perform, but that the problems reflected in this film are worth thinking deeply about each and every one of us. From a small classroom, we can peep into the whole society. The Nazis have never been far away and have always been in the hearts of all of us.
