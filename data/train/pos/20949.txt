Garrulous lines, some documentary designs. Movies that are different can not be easily classified into any type of film. But is it more or less likely to be aesthetically tired for EN? I didn't see a big breakthrough. His performance does not seem to dig deeper into the heart of the protagonist of such a film. What a pity.
