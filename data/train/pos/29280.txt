There are jokes, stories, moves, and plots. This is the New year's film of eight generations, which is surprisingly good. Er Dongsheng's best style film in recent years has fully returned to the golden Hong Kong film in the 1990s. Don't scrutinize the plot or look into the details. The picture is just fun. The actor's performance is too full and vivid, and the audience keeps laughing. The number of Nobles in old Beijing sounds too cordial.
