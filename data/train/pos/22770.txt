The score on Douban dropped sharply, which once affected my judgment of the film. Fortunately, I finally went to the cinema to see the film. The implicit and introverted way of expression presses the emotion deeply. It is this traditional and conservative emotional expression of the Chinese people that really moves people. If I don't see you again, what can I do if I see you again? Maybe it's goodbye. There are some emotions, whether seen or not, is ultimately a kind of regret!
