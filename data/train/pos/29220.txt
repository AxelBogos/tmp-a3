The whole movie is like a beautiful but regrettable dream in the juvenile summer vacation. In the dream, there are cola cans turned into penguins, huge mystery creatures, adult-flavored unsweetened coffee, incredible events waiting to be explored, and mysterious big sisters with soft breasts. At the end, I think of the young girl who travels through time and space, looking forward to meeting again one day, although this dream may be forgotten when I grow up, and I may not forget it. This kind of confidence that I will not forget is probably the loveliest part of teenagers.
