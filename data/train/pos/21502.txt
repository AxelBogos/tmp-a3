It is still a big scene with extremely intense visual effects, but fortunately, after watching five episodes in a row, I do feel that the pace is a little slower, everything is advancing in an expected rhythm, and there is no accident without loss. Maybe the only thing that surprised me was Yoda. After watching five episodes, I finally saw Master Yoda make a move. A master is a master, which is really extraordinary.
