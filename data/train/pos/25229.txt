This is a man's extreme yearning for a complete family, prompting him to make a story that is enough to destroy himself. Such a simple and direct reason makes it hard to hate what he has done, only infinite loss, but life is so hard on him. The exquisite and bright film reflects the fact that real life is cruel, and the unique and eerie drama coupled with Robin Williams's superb acting skills makes people shudder.
