The hue is so uncomfortable that the oppression of blue and green makes people sick. Natalina is pitiful and hateful, the ending is too ruthless but too reasonable, no zuo no die, Spanish people, this sentence is too suitable for you. It hasn't changed from Franco's time to the present. If you resist, no regime can save you.
