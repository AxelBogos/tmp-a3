Really bigger on the inside than outside; I like the setting of Obscurial very much, so I feel very upset that Newt is willing to help them after the US Congress destroys them. Rowling's perception of contemporary social and political life is indeed very sensitive, insinuating; finally, I like nerd-shaped freckles too!
