The death of Wang Bo in history is so heartbreaking. Looking at the high-spirited Wang Bo in white in the movie, he always feels that life is impermanent when he thinks that he will soon drown in the sea. The movie treats Wang Bo as both real and illusory, trying to dilute this sense of tragedy. Liu Xiaofeng is very suitable for the role of a chic literati, and his arrogance and eagerness to be appreciated is vivid.
