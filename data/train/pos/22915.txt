Although it is not enough impact and the information is scattered, it is still a good movie. The director tells a very Japanese story in a very European way. Matsumoto Shinxiang elevator scene is very good, Guangmei's last two scenes are also very good. There are some perspectives of the narrative with self-reconstruction, but also very good. But I don't like the bus part. The beginning is good and the end is pretentious. I don't like them pretending to be college students. I'm really not young.
