I think I have to give this movie five stars. I can see how much effort Wu Jing has spent in this movie. The story is tense from beginning to end, so that you can't catch your breath. This is a disadvantage. The total length of the movie is only one and a half hours. You can totally add another 20 minutes to control the rhythm. On the whole, apart from the domestic team of the special effects of the wolves, there is no way to be better, and the others are regarded as the best productions in domestic films.
