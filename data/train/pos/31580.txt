There is no love for no reason, no hate for no reason. This is good, after such suffering, you stand out, afraid of social indifference, snobbish like your tragic experience when you are young, this is understandable. But why take revenge on the only person who gives you warmth in indifference? I didn't ask you to return the favor, but why would I bite the hand that feeds you?
