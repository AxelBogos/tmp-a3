Oh, my God, only by watching this movie can I understand why so many people like to watch basketball games. Camera language and soundtrack, as well as just the right mute. The coach withdrew from that game when he received a phone call from his wife. There was a fierce confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States in the last three seconds. It seems that only the Soviet Union and China can naturally discharge the sense of collectivism. The 10th is really awesome!
