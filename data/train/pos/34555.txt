I seldom watch science fiction, let alone the game, but this one gives me a good feeling. First of all, the rhythm is really good, the whole process will be gradually attracted, and then the later team will like one; then it is wonderful enough in terms of content. Solving puzzles in the game also implies reality, almost all foreshadowing, especially the mysterious family photo, people can not help but guess the true identity of the people behind and deeper contradictions. Looking forward to a more fierce competition in the future.
