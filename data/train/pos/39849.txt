The truth braved the wind and snow to enter the long-lost cinema on the premiere day. I really haven't seen a movie in the cinema for a long time. Tell me about the feeling: Qiu Le played by Ren Dahua and Huo Jianhua is responsible for funny and humorous, Zhang he is responsible for psychology, Xie Tianyou is responsible for revenge, and the actress is responsible for emotional betrayal. Very good-looking, no matter what others say, I think it looks good! Fans who have their own ideas can go and have a look! I think a man should have a conscience!
