As a whole, the reduction degree of comics can be said to be the highest among the three versions of Spider-Man. Boss set to a high praise, not a completely bad person, combat effectiveness is not particularly high, very suitable for the bug this fledgling pro-people superhero. And because of what I saw in BFI, the 3D effect is excellent, adding one star.
