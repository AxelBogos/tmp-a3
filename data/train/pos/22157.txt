3D experience is good, decadent beauty of the male is very handsome, from time to time there is a small plum fixed view, the female acting skills are relatively weak, expressionless from beginning to end. What is more amazing is Rihanna's transformation dance, which is completely tailor-made for her! The visual effect of the whole film is perfect, the scene is imaginative, and the switch between real and virtual world is beyond imagination! Overall 4-star recommendation
