Shudder all over the body of every pore, wasted a pale prosperity and loneliness. 100 stars is excellent, the mix is great, the tone and rhythm match perfectly, and every time the cello is played, the whole person feels as if everything around him has come to a standstill, replaced by the desolate loneliness of being alone. It doesn't matter whether you are lonely or unruly, as long as you have been as gorgeous as fireworks, the sky will leave traces.
