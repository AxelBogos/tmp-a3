What else can I say about Mr. Wen's work, no matter how warm the ending is? at the beginning, I also wondered when the wedding dress mixed with Sanxiu was latent and successful. After seeing it, I was sure that it was only after saving the son. I was only controlled by her before. ROSE did not play much this time, but ELISE was very good, PATRICK was also good, and the last candle blowing was very funny!
