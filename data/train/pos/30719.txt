In the middle of seeing it, I was still obsessed with the fact that Rio de Janeiro is a city in South Africa and should be influenced by the World Cup. This famous film is obviously my favorite. The way of circular narration, the switching of lens, the uncertainty of the story, the portrayal of picture and human nature. All right, watch it again some other time.
