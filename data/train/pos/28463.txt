"Love is about touching and withdrawing your hand." Love, which is too implicit, is really uncomfortable to see. But Hopkins's eyes are amazing! Behind every restraint and courtesy of Stevens, is the surge in his heart about to drown him? There is no need to regard it only as a fruitless love, it is also the last dirge of an imperial sunset. The Duke's silent back, like Stevens, is an inchoate sadness. The unspoken love for Miss Kenton, the understanding of the Duke, and the dissatisfaction with the politics of the situation were all hidden in the eyes that wanted to talk. If you snoop, he's going to hide it again.
