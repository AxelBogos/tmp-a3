I thought it would be the same as the books of Uncle long legs that I read in high school. It was a tender story that someone silently guarded and accompanied you to grow up. Ever since childhood, my mysterious uncle has been watching you bit by bit, sending you a bouquet of flowers when you are sad, and jumping over the envelope to cheer for you when you are happy. But this film makes the story of Daddy long legs touching and sad. This is a story about secret love.
