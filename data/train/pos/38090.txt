Brother Cohen! The imitation ability of Koreans is at its peak! Black, out of control, humorous, ironic, this film has all the characteristics of the Cohen brothers style film, coupled with Jin Zhiyun signature lens, great! Seeing one death after another, the family got used to filling the hole until the end, laughing directly. Jin Zhiyun went to Hollywood to make action movies. It was a waste of style.
