When your hair reaches to your waist, I will return to the court in triumph. In the past, they were all young heroes who were carefree and carefree. The east is beautiful, and the west lake is misty. Armed with a bloody battle in all directions, vowing to keep the mountains and rivers. There should be a victorious return day to spend the night with the secretary of state. Looking forward to the end of life hand in hand, willing to robe with your son.
