The parents in the film have the characteristics of an oriental family. The mother is patient and reserved, but she has excessive desire for control and protection. The father is stubborn, full of sadness and unwilling to admit it. The unfortunate ones who were willing to change stopped the deterioration of the wound, but also left scars that were difficult to heal. We were moved by the desperate rescue of our mother and the compromise that our father finally let go, because it was our dream of understanding, recognition and protection, and we all imagined that it was our own hand that reached out the window to feel the wind.
