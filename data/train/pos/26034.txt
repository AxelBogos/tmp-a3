As a film from the 1970s, it now seems surprising. Compared with my parents, who were in their 20s at that time, we can see the cultural differences. It is true that Hong Kong's attitude towards comrades did not jump to what it is today, but the film was still released, causing an uproar at that time. While the mainland is still an era with only Mao, Taiwan Island is still under Chiang Kai-shek's shadow, and comrades are still being persecuted. Looking back on tonight, I feel sorry.
