Cool youth people think that the film changes to the original point of view. The death of Tsuda "I really want to sit on the horse"I want to be in the sky!" The resistance to violence is a bit extreme, but it fully shows Tsuda's desire for freedom is not as self-defeating as in the short story. In Nagano's death movie, Nagano is even stronger wearing a black hat and playing the violin.
