It is said that the prototype of the character has passed away. Salute. The epic of civilian heroes. I have to admit that Gao Qunshu is a great director, not good at long lenses in hand-held photography, not good at author style, good at daring to be approachable, powerful in the divine training of amateur actors, and always keenly aware of fictional reality. Of course, there are a few shabby old roads that are silent.
