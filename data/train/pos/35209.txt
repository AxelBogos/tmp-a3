It's a great movie. I have always felt that there is a perverted soul behind the perfect man with no faults, and I stay away from that kind of man. As for myself, every time I act like a perfect and innocent Holy Father, I will coldly laugh at myself and the people around me-if they really believe that this is who I am. Yes, I have the potential of a cold-blooded killer.
