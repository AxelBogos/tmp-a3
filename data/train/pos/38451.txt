It's a classic, and it's infectious enough! The first section of the Odessa ladder is an excellent interpretation of Eisenstein's "collision montage" theory. More than 150 short shots extend the time, shocking people, and quickly switch in sharp contrast in the scene, seat and subject. The metaphor montage of sleeping lion-squatting lion-jumping lion is full of charm. The structure of the play is a classic five-act play, with strong composition, soundtrack, rhythm and red flag as the highlights. (9.0 take 10)
