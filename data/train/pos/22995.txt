It's all right for a little movie, if you don't expect much. This movie reminds me of he Junxiang, thinking that when I was young, Edison Chen, Nicholas Tse and he Junxiang were the three most loved ones in my heart. With the growth of age, he Junxiang seems to be out. However, he is now moving towards film, which is a wise move. After all, idol dramas have no future. For example, he starred in "Seven days in Love with you" is very good.
