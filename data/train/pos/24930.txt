This ghost is the most interesting and disgusting in "Dead Snow 2 D ø d Sn ø 2", even its occasional slight calls are interesting. I don't usually like watching zombie movies with flying intestines, but some classic serious but disgusting clips in this movie turn those flying intestines (this one is also a lot) into ordinary disgusting. We have to order a pizza and watch it.
