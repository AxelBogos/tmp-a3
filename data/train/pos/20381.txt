A movie from 2000. I seem to have seen it before, but I can't remember the plot. I watched it again today. At that time, Tony Leung, Zheng Yijian, Kelly Chen and Cecilia Cheung were handsome and beautiful, and they all looked very pleasing to the eye. The movie is a magical existence, like a time machine that makes people look young. The storyline is not bad.
