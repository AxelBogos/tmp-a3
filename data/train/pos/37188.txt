Five points. Ten best bookings for 2019 people, the whole style is suspected of Edward Hopper style dynamic images, dog blood and illogical plots are filmed dreamy and ghostly, Asako's gaze and gaze are photographed, and the resulting peep or gaze mirrors each other with the audience (pay attention to her black eyeliner), audio-visual language processing of Kurosawa and Ozu, close-ups and emotional transmission of Casavitz, Hitchcock stories and characters, Bresson editing It is a film completely different from the "Shadow" of Bi Gan Earth. No one in the world knows why we roam aimlessly and endlessly, whether it is beautiful, chaotic or dream. all we know is that the river is dirty, but it flows and flows all the time. I think of this song by Duoduo:
"Girl Polka."
Same pride, same trick.
These free girls
These girls who are going to be queens
Will go to the ends of the earth for love
Will follow the bad guys and never change their minds.
-- Todo 1973
