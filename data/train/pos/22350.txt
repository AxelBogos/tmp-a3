Although we know that the director wants to expose human nature, the background of this story is in middle school, which leads to welfare giving in many places. I watched it as a third-tier film at first. It is not ruled out that the old hooligan, Shinzu Xin er, has a selfish interest in watching violence and pornography. There are already many people in Japan who like it. And the so-called exposure of human nature is actually very inadequate, very shallow, but the scene is big, many people died, and others dare not play like this, which gives him extra points.
