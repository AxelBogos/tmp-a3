When I first saw it, I just went to college, and I didn't understand the confusion of the young people rendered by the film. When I saw it for the second time, it had been three years since I graduated, and I didn't even miss the tidbits. I empathize with every line and every expression of Hoffman. The scene of two young people turning from laughter to confusion after escaping from the wedding scene is very shocking, but this masterstroke is due to the fact that the director did not shout cards after the actor finished the script, but filmed a little longer!
