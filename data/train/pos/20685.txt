Many comments say that as long as you have experienced bullying, you will never forgive, but in fact, the world is diverse, and people are different in character, mentality, tolerance and acceptability. whether murderers should carry out the death penalty is a moral topic that can be discussed around the world, let alone bullying. Have those who say they don't forgive ever wonder what they can do with bullies? Look back and let each other go. I think this is the core of the film's expression.
