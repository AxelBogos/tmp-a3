This kind of hard science fiction looks very enjoyable. Although he has never been immersed in various TV movies of Star Trek in the United States, the two movies that focus on the launch are also very interesting. I really can't stand the rotten girls and boys who talk about gay love. Now, as long as it is a film with two men as the protagonists, it is not gay. I wipe it once or twice. I'm not tired of doing every film like this, and I'm not tired of playing with the rest of others.
