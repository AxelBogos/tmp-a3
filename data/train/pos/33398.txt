I like the twisted posture of the heroine, the sunrise on the lake of father and son, and the burning wheelchair. What really happens is the truth, art is a big lie, and communism is a basement. The main line of the story is actually clear and credible, like a different flower on the ruins. It was the heaviest joke.
