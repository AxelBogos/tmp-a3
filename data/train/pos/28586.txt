The United States is willing to face history, and the director is wise to choose such a theme with extra points. This film makes us feel once again the inhuman living conditions of blacks who are oppressed because of race. Twelve years is torture for this free man, but he is always working hard and hopeful, and it is even more difficult to describe those blacks who have been slaves for life. It is expected that there will be such a real film in China, not for the purpose of construction and publicity.
