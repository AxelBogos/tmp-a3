The story is a good story, and the film is also good. If the audience brings into the perspective and psychology of the protagonist, they will have a good viewing experience, and at the same time deeply realize the doomed tragic fate of innocent individuals involved in political events. The British Army and the Republican Army of Northern Ireland each played 50 boards, revealing that militants on both sides deliberately carried out killings, constantly provoking conflicts and deepening hatred for each other. When the wounded soldier was caught, the tension and suspense that had been created suddenly disappeared, the groundwork went as expected, the young IRA members hesitated to shoot again, and the British soldiers narrowly escaped death. and see through the gloom of the bureaucracy, and finally abandon the self-identity of soldiers. But he doesn't seem to have a strong sense of identity with the country, nationality or religion at first, and the dispute in Northern Ireland is caused by fanatical nationalists and religious followers, so liberals are the best destination for individuals. Overall, the latter part is less than the previous tension, shock is not enough.
