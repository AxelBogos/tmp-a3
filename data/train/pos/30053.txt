I haven't seen such a movie with such a huge amount of information for a long time, which goes beyond the scope of the film and reaches the poem collection film (self-created words). Its artistry comes from the narration of multiple lines, as well as various metaphorical narratives of people, events and backgrounds. You can only look at it for the first time, and you can't understand it until you see it two or three more times.
