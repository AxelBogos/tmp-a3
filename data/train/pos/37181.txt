Although the plot is a little far-fetched and somewhat illogical, the film does play up the feelings too well, and the characters express themselves incisively and vividly, not only the positive characters, but also the negative characters. The whole story may feel nothing new, and the writer is a little sorry for some details, but I think the film itself is 100 points.
