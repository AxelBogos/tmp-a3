It's better in a bunch of bad movies recently, with a score of 7.5. The storyline and characterization are nothing new, but the rhythm is lively and does not procrastinate, and it does not look annoying. The final final shot well, twists and turns, during which it was properly interspersed with the performance of various off-court roles, playing a good foil and contrast effect. Looking at the scene of the Red Flag of the Soviet Union versus the Stars and Stripes of the United States, I can't help thinking of the recent Sino-US trade war. I still feel that the result of the competition is quite cool, hehe.
