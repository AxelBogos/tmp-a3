The fate of the characters at the bottom has always been the theme of director Coris Markey. Helplessness, helplessness, and even rising up against it are all so weak, but the flashing friendship and love, although briefly wavering, give them the courage to live. No matter rich or poor, everyone has a dream, everyone has the right to pursue a normal life, and no one should ignore the existence of others.
