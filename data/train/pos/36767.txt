Read the Cantonese version, although the dubbing is a little strange, but several places are really hilarious, at the same time there are moving tears. Fiona is really too beautiful and too young. Tsai Tsai feels that he has broken through himself. Zheng Zhongji is naturally funny. Haha. It is said that the theme song is really sweet, and I "happened" to hear Fang Datong's rap, which is also another kind of perfection of khafi. ❤️ still wants to brush the Mandarin version again.
