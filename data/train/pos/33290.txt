Does the room move the space, or does the space move the room? Or is the box court where the audience is moving? Through the transition of space and space, forcing the audience to open their eyelids, the audience can see that the room is made and decomposed, and the characters are created and dismembered. The audience was caught up in it, trapped in a malicious swamp disguised as a fairy tale-such as a big bad wolf disguised as a grandmother. Such a violent movie.
