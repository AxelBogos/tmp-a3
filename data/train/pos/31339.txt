Just after watching the midnight show with my boyfriend, my boyfriend slept several times, but he relied on everyone and left us with the rhythm. Because middle school really loved Changan scribbling a novel, I always supported me to read it. There were a lot of scenes in the middle that wanted to cry, not because of the movie itself. I told him at the end of the show that I already told you that it might be a rotten film, and he said, is this rotten film? is this rotten film? this is rotten film.
