First of all, the story is still wonderful, compared with the previous work Beng Junhao also upgraded. It is also about class differences. Li Cangdong hides needles in his heart, while Feng Junhao hides a knife in his smile. The "truth" in the comedy is even more naked, laughing and laughing, and those who can't laugh are the power of the movie. Upper class and underground, like reincarnation, are quite inexplicable.
