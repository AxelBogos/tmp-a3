I think it's very interesting. I don't know why it was cut. Maybe most people think it's dull or can't understand it. Hong Kong true production is indeed very attentive, and the questions raised are also very sharp and there is no right or wrong, especially on religious issues, giving a more objective observer perspective. The casting is also in place, and the actors and actresses have basically handed in good answers.
