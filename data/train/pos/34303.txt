It's a pretty good thriller I've seen recently. The form is super novel, and the sense of reality on the full screen is so strong that people don't notice and think you're one of them. The whole process can be regarded as a long shot to come down, the acting skills of the actors are really not to say, whether it is laughing, scolding, frightened and mad, is it not NG? The criticism of human nature is also in place, and all the protagonists deserve it. It was an old story of vengeance against ghosts and ghosts, which was filmed with new ideas.
