Generally speaking, the quality of the four stories in this film is relatively high, and their styles are different, which is very consistent with the creative theme of this series. The story atmosphere of the first "Snow Mountain Ghost" directly laid the tone of the whole film. The story of "four Corner Circulation" was not reflected for a while in the film, and it was not reached by the screenwriter get to this scary point. "Mobile General" as a fantasy theme is still quite imaginative. It can be regarded as a time travel drama in another sense.
