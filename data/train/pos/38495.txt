Several words from May moved me, "do you still think I'm your girlfriend?" You are more friendly to any citizen of Hong Kong than your female friends. " That's what she said when she came back alone from Bali. "I don't care that the enemies you get into when you are a policeman involve me. All I care about is that you have no time to accompany me." These are the words in the breakup letter she gave him. When he asked her on the cruise if she didn't want him to be a policeman, she said, "A boyfriend who is a policeman is very handsome."
