In the "harvest" of oriental thinking, Hou Xiaoxian has always been good at delaying internal grief while silent Hou Xiaoxian has always been good at this assassin's silent forest, cicada, wind, lake, grass and mountain fog. In line with all the imagination of knight-errant knight-errant, every frame of vision is breathtaking beauty, thinking of the Japanese killer girl Amenie Yinniang, who was deeply impressed by her adolescence, received the extreme motion and died in the blink of an eye. Almost the whole film is practicing and admiring.
