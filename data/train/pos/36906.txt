The most unique war film in recent years, in this era of film assembly line, every time I see experimental techniques, I will be extremely excited, this is such a movie. The tank sight is simply the best camera; the repression of the whole film in the enclosed space and the last-minute subjective point of view are the unique creation of this war movie. The burning mother and peeing in front of prisoners of war are deeply impressed.
