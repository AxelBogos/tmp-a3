Personal experience: there is a lot of tension in each scene in the first half of the film, but after the end of the second half is guessed, the sense of suspense is greatly weakened. At this point, I prefer the "annihilation" approach. As for the best part in the end, "Midsummer" is still inferior to "genetic doom". However, the sunlight overflowing the screen can at least make people full of ðŸ˜„ after watching the movie.
