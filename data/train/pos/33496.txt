Even if it is such a simple plot, it is really touching to be able to shoot so well in the hands of Disney, and it is always nice not to be disappointed. Wolf and bear are so cute. The special effects of the whole animal are invincible. I actually feel a little tired when I imagine the little boy supporting the whole film alone. PS, it turns out that elephants are divine Boss.
