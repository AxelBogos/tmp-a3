First of all, I would like to say that I have seen a play, and then I heard that it was made into a movie, and I was quite excited. In particular, the protagonists are Guo Jingfei and Dili Reba. After watching the morning movie today, I was very satisfied and happily wrote down my feelings in the cinema.
