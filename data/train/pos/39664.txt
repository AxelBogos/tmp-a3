Can a prison cell be decorated like this? It turns out that watermelons can still be drawn with lines? Is the prison super-loose? The grandmother commuted the death sentence to a prisoner who had been sentenced to death for so long. It seems that I am really rare and strange. There is a shadow of "nuns are crazy" in the harmony part. But in any case, the above comments are not enough to reduce the score of this film. To give up the continuous affection of the family, the indelible humanity, and the care and kind treatment of special groups are the bright spots that can resonate with the audience.
