From the first shot of the film, I thought it was Kieslowski's film, because his lens was always concise and informative. If you don't look at it carefully or listen carefully, you miss it all. Although he is already so famous, he forgot to check the basic information when looking at it. I may be the only one to understand the film, this is the story of the old judge's life, there is no Valentine and Auguste, this is just a private story.
