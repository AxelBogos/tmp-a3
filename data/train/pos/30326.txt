German humor is hard to understand. When the Knockin' on heaven's Door at the end of the film sounded, the plot of the film reached the best part.
People, the most precious is life, life is only once for everyone, how should the only life be spent? Whenever you recall the past, you can not regret for wasting your time or be ashamed of mediocrity.
Carpe Diem
