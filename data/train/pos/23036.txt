Your young friends are the best friends of your life, because they haven't had time to see the whole of each other, or the scars and pus left behind after the recalcitrant struggle with society and years. So now, the face we see in each other's hearts is the face that no longer exists. Then say the name, and the face that no longer exists will be clear again from each other's face and become the person in each other's eyes.
