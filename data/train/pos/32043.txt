A superhero movie full of positive energy! The fight scene uses slow motion many times, with Hans Zimmer's amazing soundtrack in "Super Ball", every time he takes off, every block, every breakthrough, every time. All are amazingly handsome (beautiful)! The female director Warner chose wisely, incorporated the unique nuance of female thinking into the film style, the spiritual atmosphere is laudable, and several times can not help but want to applaud.
