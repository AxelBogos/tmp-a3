The themes of financial wars and economic agents are relatively rare. The tension is good. The main theme has a strong flavor. The credibility may not be high enough to feel that both sides of the attack and defense of a real financial war will not be so weak; secondly, it is too abrupt for a man to become a decathlon fighter from a rookie to the end. ★★★☆
