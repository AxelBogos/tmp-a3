Marlon Brando felt much worse when he was young and when he was old. Although he acted well in the play, I have to say that such a man is really disgusting. Vivien Leigh acted unexpectedly well, muttered to herself and lied to others, but never took the initiative to harm others, and was too timid to break through the shackles to seek her own true happiness, which eventually led to a tragedy. It is said that Blanche's sister is the culprit, thanks!
