This is the heaviest movie I have seen in recent years. How can there be three people who love each other and share a room? How can this kind of film still be made? And how can this strange values still be filmed in such literature and art? How good are these three actors to show that they are full of love and lust? In addition, most of the people who studied psychology in the early days really had "diseases" of their own, and they had to study and practice their own theories.
