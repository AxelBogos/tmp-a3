Jackie Chan is not a director, but a martial arts director at most. How noble and tragic the revolution was at the beginning! Uncle is great, Sun Wen is great! Jackie Chan actually performed very well, but with the assassin, Huang Xing really turned into a dragon in a second. Luckily, it was less than a minute. Yuan Shikai is also very good, Chen Chong is also very good (suddenly found that Xiao S looks a bit like Chen Chong lost), Hu GE is also very good, all the supporting roles are good, Li Bingbing forget it. Anyway, it's worth it.
