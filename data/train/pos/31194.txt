Five stars. I have seen it three times in the cinema, and the scene is close to sold-out. I also think this is the most outstanding work of Wes Anderson so far. The narrative is so wonderful and compact. His writing and directing skills are really skillful. Looking forward to the day when Wes Anderson becomes the next Steven Spielberg (Hello! ).
