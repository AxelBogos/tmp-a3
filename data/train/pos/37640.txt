Look, I'm asleep. When I wake up, I keep looking. Always challenge the boring film, always fail. Some people think that Wendes is making a mystery, and only those who understand his strong feelings of homesickness understand the long shot of his expression. All five points. A movie that is so beautiful from the music to the camera. By contrast, the Yankees are a bunch of vulgar guys. The tune of PS,Nick Cave is really suitable for here.
