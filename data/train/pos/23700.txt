I guess a large number of children who used to "learn something" will be poked to tears, even if they are wives in their own small circle, when they return to the big world, you are still the one who is out of place. Bao Whale said that everyone's bright spot deserves to be respected, and it may be more "approachable" than the folk music revival advocated by the film itself, so even if the completion of the film has just passed the passing line in the same type of film, I am also willing to give a high emotional score.
