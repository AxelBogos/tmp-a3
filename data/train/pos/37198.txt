It's a pity that I didn't see the Marapat villa on my top-notch trip to Capri last year / the dynamic interpretation of the building with the camera at the end is excellent / the overall use of high-end Italian colors in the film is chic and extremely stylish / it is also the most rhythmically comfortable in the Godal movies I have ever seen.
