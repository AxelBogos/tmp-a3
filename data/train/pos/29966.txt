I have a natural aversion to the stubbornness of the hostess. From my present point of view, I once wanted to slap her, but at the end of the story, I condemned my impulsive feelings. Her behavior has its own soil and circumstances, as well as the gap between age and the times, so it is positive to put herself in her shoes. But in any case, it is still a film that can't move me.
