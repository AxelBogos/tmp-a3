Although it is a children's movie, I watch it with relish. Life is supposed to be more junior high school and pay more attention to self-needs. People who are too mature will not find the meaning of life. They can only rely on bars to eliminate their loneliness and people become better. It is the theme of the movie, but in the circle of friends of superheroes, such friends are also needed to adjust the dreary atmosphere, Superman. Batman carries too much sadness and responsibility, only a lonely heart, while Shazan is only 14 years old, there is a splendid life, and there are no scruples of secondary two, such a life is too beautiful. Shazan's character is not attractive, but if it is too charming, it does not conform to the mentality of 14 years old.
