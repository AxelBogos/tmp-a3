India's film reflecting social problems, the inequality between men and women caused by the bondage of religious traditions, refuses to accept the progress of civilization. The shooting quality is very high, the actors are also very good, at the end of the sudden change in concept, I feel that the treatment is slightly rough and not delicate enough. It's always a little awkward to change too fast. The whole is good, it's worth seeing.
