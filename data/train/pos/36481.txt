The story is amazing! It's like putting a cult B story in a particularly exquisite package, but after feeling it, I feel that it is not only not inconsistent but also cool. The roles of uncle and nephew and their various interactions are really fond of. Finally, I would like to praise Ma Xiaomi, who is beautiful and dangerous is really the best endorsement of this role. I don't think Ke Shu Fa Shark Fu Lanlan is more suitable for this role than he is! Praise while wiping nosebleed
