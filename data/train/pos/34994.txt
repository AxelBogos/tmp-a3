Maybe Pirates of the Caribbean is not a very thought-provoking work, but it at least taught me that you have to wait until the lights out on the screen to watch a movie-I wonder if anyone has noticed that there is a story of less than a minute after the end of the first film. changed the fate of a very important character in the play. Haha, so be sure to wait until the end next time, there may be a surprise!
