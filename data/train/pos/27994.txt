A devout prodigal man, always disrespectful to Jesus, drank all the wine and tasted the beauty of the world. "I'm just saying what I think, because what's in my head is always more interesting than what's around me." He is not a cynic in the golden age, but a stronghold and a loner in the turbid age.
