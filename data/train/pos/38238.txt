There are too many things you want to express, but you don't have to say them all in lines. Movies are not declarative sentences but exclamatory sentences. It is dangerous to express them in a hurry, and the writer may not know it. But the feelings are real, Deng Chao's performance is intact, this is true, I like Bai Yu, this is true. It is not necessary to be comprehensive, but it is necessary to have a clear target. This is the case with education, and so is watching movies. Grow up, Ma Fei.
