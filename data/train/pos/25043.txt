A standard J-Horror. Yoshio Nakamura, who can shoot anything, has become an authentic director with a vague face. In the film, the resentful spirit does not show the true face, but twists and crawls the shadow, more like the hideous ghost of confinement and contagion in Kurosawa's "Loop". I prefer to deduce the story of architecture from time to time, and it seems to relieve the audience's addiction at the end, but does the audience really eat this?
