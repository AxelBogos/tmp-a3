In the compressed version of a typical TVB TV series, in the countdown to more than 20 minutes, there are several times where the end does not end, and finally gives a very bloody ending, which makes you instantly begin to think about whether there is something wrong with the universal values that you usually respect. Several big reversals in the film, coupled with some humorous episodes, are quite fascinating, so give 3.8 stars.
