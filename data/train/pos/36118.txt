I think, if I have cancer, the choice may be to actively cooperate with the treatment to live longer, or to leave honorably, if I see me half go to the refrigerator to get a bottle of cold beer, I choose the latter, go to a place where I feel comfortable, drink and watch a movie, give some money to the bartender, if I don't come to see me one day, if I die, bury me under a tree and hate the feeling of direct sunlight. At the end of the movie, facing that T-intersection, I thought, if it were me, I would choose to move forward, sure enough. Depp lost the charm of his youth in the play, but he was still free and easy. I hope everyone will not waste every second. I hope everyone will stick to his choice.
