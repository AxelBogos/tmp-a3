It's so interesting that it's different from any western I've ever seen before. The literary drama is excellent, and the four excellent male actors naturally explore life between their actions, blooming their philosophy one by one. While not losing the magnificent beauty of the west, they portrayed the characters and times in detail, they passed through the process of civilization, witnessed the loyalty of the rivers and lakes, and finally returned to the warmth of the family. All the way to the expedition finally lost greed, the prodigal son returned home first intention answer, wonderful!
