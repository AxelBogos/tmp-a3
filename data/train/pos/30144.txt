Ben San is not terrible. Hong Kong-flavor chicken soup is terrible. The two women who are "in their thirties" interpret diametrically opposite attitudes and feelings. There is a high contrast between "mourning" and "music". Directly attack the resonance caused by the growing sense of self-crisis and personal reflection. The growth story of "empathy" and the psychological criticism of "precision and delicacy". Perhaps all the way through difficulties, exhausted; but also to retain the courage to overthrow the past and start from scratch.
