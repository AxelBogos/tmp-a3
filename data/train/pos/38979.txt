I haven't seen the play, but I feel that the movie is still a good description of the chaos of Shinjuku song and dancer. the most impressive part is the part where Gang escaped in the street with a picture of Li Xiang. They already have the courage to want to die, and what can't they face? As an interspersed between the two factions, Brother Gang has a kind heart. When I think of Infernal Affairs, I want to be a good person.
