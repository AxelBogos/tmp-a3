Use a large number of recent scenes to frame the aquatic face into the picture, through his perspective and the "connotation" revealed on his face to show the destruction of people by Shanghai gangs in this era. The tone is always foggy, like a layer of ashes in one's heart. The sunset in the countryside and the scene like small bridge and flowing water let the audience breathe a sigh of relief from the depression. But one after another. The last oblique picture in the film implies that Cuihua's daughter has the same fate as Jinbao.
