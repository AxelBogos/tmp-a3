I remember I was in junior high school when I saw it.
At that time, I was really looking forward to my future.
I have been looking forward to love since I was a child.
Maybe that's it. I've seen too much.
But suddenly found a movie that I really wanted to finish.
Super happy and excited
Because I originally wanted to see the little thing of "first love", but it came out by mistake that "first love is not satisfied".
Like it very much, pure love
And I always think of JJ instead of him, I think he should have such a love, should have such a beautiful, shy love.
It's like giving me a shot to wake up.
To understand what should not be done, to understand that it is time to let go.
The male and female's appearance is also very online, the acting skill is also very good, although does not cause me to resonate very much, but sometimes is really very sweet.
Those things that will not be forgotten until old age are the best marks of youth.
