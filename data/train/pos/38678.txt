In fact, I want to play four and a half stars, because it still ends in Hollywood style. I haven't seen such a dystopian social science film that makes people feel in a while. I am more and more moved by it. I don't care what colors are used alternately. It's all shit. All I know is that we are all citizens of Happy Valley. Our colors are sprinkled inside our bodies. Happy Valley can now be translated as Harmony Valley.
