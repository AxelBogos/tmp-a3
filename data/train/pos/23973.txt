It's super fun, and the visual effects are super great.
Freddie's discussion and fighting is my favorite one, and I don't accept rebuttal.
It is rare for Freddie to meet his opponent and have a good time.
Think of the scene of Hercules vs. Scorpion Killer in Scorpion Warriors.
Finally, Jason came out with Freddie's head, and Freddie winked to the audience, which was the biggest colored egg in the Freddie series.
20181023, still shocking.
