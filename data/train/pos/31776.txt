Because of Dongmu, selfishness added one more point. I prefer the end of the film to the feeling of the whole story, shooting scenes full of green grass from the outer wall of the prison. I don't even want to stay on Tata too much to show this period of life. People can get a glimpse of his past and his single state of mind, leaving this small part of the blank to digest, review, and accept. Perhaps every time you think and proudly "live in the present", you can't help but have regrets growing at the same time.
