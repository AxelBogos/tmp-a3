When I saw Qingzhou not long ago, I thought that the bead left behind, and I brazenly thought that the temperament of the film matched me very much, and I kept thinking about the director. In the past few days, it has sprung up all of a sudden, and it has taken a week to go through all the Zhang Lv works that can be found, and this judgment is more accurate. This article on Geese is quite like a sequel to Qingzhou. Zhang Lu's film is probably characterized by recounting a feeling from various perspectives. I am quite fond of this style, but I can't get tired of it anyway (Old Master and Lu Ban flashed through my mind, giggling). Thanks to the Internet and Mr. Zhang Lu, it is a pity that the domestic film soil is still not suitable for this kind of people.
