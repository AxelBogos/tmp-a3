The most powerful movie in DC. The point of violence is ahead of time, and almost all the characters are moved out, and this one can also explain some of the later plots, such as the clown escaping into decency in the opposite world of the parallel universe. Professor Jigeng is absolutely right in the end, you flapped the wings of the butterfly effect, and I, as a villain, have to bear all this and become a curse? This film can also be regarded as a turnaround for some second-tier protagonists in the Justice League.
