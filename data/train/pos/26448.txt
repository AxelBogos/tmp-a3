The jet lag at the end comes from "80 days around the world"? The Hong Kong-made comedies of that era were really amazing. Obviously the joke is so obvious, the plot is so dramatic, but I still think it's funny. Even the performance of a positive spirit is not embarrassing, "not to do without development" ah.
