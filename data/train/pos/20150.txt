Bad translators kill people! If you make a bad translation of a foreign language film, you don't have any temper. The translation of the lines is not right, the sign language part does not even have subtitles, it is still an abridged version, after watching the cloud in the fog. After reading the full version, it can be counted as a first aid. But in any case, the picture and tone are pretty good.
