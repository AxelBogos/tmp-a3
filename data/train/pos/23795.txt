I haven't seen so many Hong Kong movies for a long time. It's a watershed story, but it's not a 29-year-old story. I don't hate the dramatic way of presentation. Many people want Huang Tianle's character to live the life of Lin Ruojun. In fact, most of the time our lives are not going well because Huang Tianle's appearance has the character of Lin Ruojun.
