88Aver 100 discusses the love psychology of modern women. Women in love develop towards two personalities in two directions. The titles Asako I and Asako II are these two personalities presented by girls in the face of two male masters. Several scenes emphasize the key action of "gaze", and the point chosen by the film is very tricky and accurate. It seems that after "I don't rely on you anymore" and "I don't trust you anymore", I find my own rhythm. Empty and nothingness, strange and ghostly, absurd and subtle, like the movie charm of "Ecstasy".
