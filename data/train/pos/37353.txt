Kubrick is the only film without control in his life, and many of its contents have not been realized in full accordance with his ideas, so that this film has long been rejected by him as his own work, and the scheduling of war scenes has demonstrated its master demeanor. Douglas, who once asked Kubrick to direct the film, wrote in his memoir: "Kubrick is an asshole, but he is always right, so he is a genius jerk." Douglas's two films with Kubrick have become representative works in his acting career.
