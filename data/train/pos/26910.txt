Before, I thought that Angel's love of beauty had nothing in common with Chanel, and I didn't expect her performance the most, but after watching this movie, I felt that Emily was pretty much the same. The actor can act in this movie, but it doesn't resonate with what I think. She has troughs and helplessness, but she has no humiliation or struggle. Like an activist who joined the Party, her position is too correct. The old man acted well. The costume is good-looking and many, better than the beautiful one.
