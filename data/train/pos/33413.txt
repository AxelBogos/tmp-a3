The people on Douban are really pretending to be pushy. No matter what the film is, they all complain that there is no bottom line, scolding the actors and directors for scolding the director and wanting to get a negative score at the end of the plot. Does it make them look cold and artistic?
The film is nothing else, at least visually enjoyable.
Follow the movie to make a long trip, many subtle scenes make people feel the same way, if you are a person with a story, then this film will inadvertently poke your tears.
