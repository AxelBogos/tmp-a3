The story is very simple, purely for Lee Chong Wei. After reading it, I like Lee Chong Wei even more, and there is a kind of insistence called Lee Chong Wei. I really feel sorry for him to see that he fell under Lin Dan in the first few years of his career. Now I play badminton less and less, but the spirit of not giving up on the court still exists. I also said it's time to work hard. The first step is to start with self-discipline.
