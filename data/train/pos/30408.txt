For many famous people, art is a self-sacrifice, integrating their body and soul into art without reservation, so that it is difficult to distinguish them from each other. It is particularly difficult for female artists to walk. French female writer Colette and Mexican female painter Frida have many overlapping lives. Colette is more fortunate than her not to experience a lot of physical pain, and the others are similar to those who are betrayed by their loved ones. he shaped and excavated and then left the aura of men and became one on his own. Androgynous, swaying, adored by men and women, lingering in sensual lust, creating their own experiences into paintings or novels. In the movie, Colette's same-sex friend Missy asked, are you happy? Colette asked, is there anyone in the world really happy? As Frida said when he left, the world was so painful that he wished it would never come again.
