Basically maintained the tone of the previous work, but too much ink on the humorous elements led to a complete lack of tension in the film, J and K still acted fiercely, and the female villain was fascinated by her figure, appearance and voice, and the last part was still curious. the previous work is that we live in a marble, this is that we live in an alien storage cabinet, speaking of where the two-headed man ended up.
