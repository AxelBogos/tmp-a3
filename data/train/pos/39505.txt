OST is good to hear again. Graduation is too much to make people cry. Xiaowei said that we were going to London, not England. We really laughed for a long time. TvT please, please. Next year, there will be another theatrical version about Zi Meow's graduation and then the trip of the five people. I was so moved by the fact that it was over so soon.
