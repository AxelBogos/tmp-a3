The word pure has been mentioned for the third time recently, but this time it is a compliment. This film is so pure that it can even become a model for all domestic youth films, properly establishing conflicts and resolving them, although these conflict points are more or less blunt in this film. but supplemented by the pure blood and dreams that should be in the youth film, it is enough to dilute these defects. Many separate scenes and editing are very good, imperfect but like a movie very much.
