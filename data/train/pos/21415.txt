When I was lying in bed watching Song Hye-kyo's boyfriend, I suddenly remembered that when I was in college, I was watching Korean TV dramas with my roommates. I only had two episodes a week. I waited so long to watch it for a while, and then I began to wait and wait again. After more than two months, I was gone, and then I was ready for a holiday. Suddenly sigh that time flies so quickly, what remains unchanged is that Song Hye-kyo is still so beautiful, and the plot is so sweet.
