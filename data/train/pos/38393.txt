# vic Movie Diary # uncut should be 186 minutes long (my version is only 179 minutes) numerous passionate debates and speeches, dare not say how much to understand, the film discusses the spirit of the law, historical examination, the internal and external forces of the political system and other issues are very profound. Chinese historical movies do not have such a quiet discussion. This is my feeling. The star show and everyone's every tremor and eyes are wonderful.
