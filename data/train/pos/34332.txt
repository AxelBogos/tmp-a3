I went to see it because I saw Zhang Jiahui's name. In fact, boxing has always been a sport that I think is too bloody and brutal. But the muscles of the two men are really exhilarating. The 48-year-old boxing champion in the movie and the 46-year-old desperate actor outside the movie are all admirable.
