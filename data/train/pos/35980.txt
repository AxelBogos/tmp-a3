Yuanzi Wen tells a postmodern story about the fate of mankind with an old-school retro texture. The sound design is very sharp. For the first time, he saw a director use sound effects to express the concepts of "emptiness" and "stillness". Quiet, quiet and silence, these abstract concepts break down sensory barriers and create a kind of synaesthesia artistic pleasure under the action of soundtrack and ambient sound.
