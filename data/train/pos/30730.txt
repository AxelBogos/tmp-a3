This director is more suitable for making rock movies than Todd Hayes. It is also about memories, and the more gorgeous montage replaces the regular editing, which can understand the plot that the director wants to convey without words. The insertion animation gives a kind of pure color, the simple expectation of love in chaos and disorder, and the childish fantasy of gender transcends the complexity of human nature and politics. After reading it, I'm just glad it's not a real adaptation.
