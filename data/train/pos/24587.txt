Although he doesn't like Zhen Yu acting as a pervert (because he has acted too much), he has to admit that he brought this pervert to life in Shuangxiong. Looking back on the plot of Shuangxiong many years later, what I can't forget is not Zheng Yijian's handsome criminal policeman, not Liming's intelligent psychiatrist, but Wu Zhenyu's pervert who can feel goose bumps when he thinks of it. The fourth star is given to the eternal movie star in my heart.
