Written in front: original screenwriter â†’ Korean screenwriter Wen Zhongri.
Because of Li Donghui's self-account in Paris, the script of the extreme career gave him the motivation to go on, so he turned it out and read it. The very standard Korean commercial action film did catch the film of public viewing orientation, and the high box office was not without reason. Because of the good results of this film, Yoo Sung-lung always smiled from ear to ear when he went to the variety show, and his "Kingdom" was interspersed with a lot of laughter at the end.
Standard Korean script, standard acting skills, standard plot trend, just like Korean fried chicken, are more likely to be loved by Korean audiences, and as overseas audiences, they will feel more or less bored. 7.3 points ~ one more star for Kong Ming's face and uncle acting skills of Yoo Jackie Yoo and Shen Hejun.
