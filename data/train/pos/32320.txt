I saw it once in high school. At that time, I thought the plot was good, but it was a bit lengthy. Today, I really have nothing to say. This is an epoch-making gangster movie and an integrated work, every scene and even the scene is permeated with the elegance and domineering of the Italian gangster, and the whole movie you will realize the rights, desires, you will understand why men like these.
