A life in the opposite direction
Met each other's love.
Maybe the road to love is too rough.
Avoid it or cry.
However, I can find you in the sea of people.
To meet you in each other's advance and retreat.
Be able to see your heart clearly in the left and right time
Everything is just right
This is the best love.
