We all live in this "world", where we fantasize, fall in love, suspect, and die. In the park where the world is condensed, space is condensed and time seems to be compressed. It takes ten seconds to get from the pyramids to Manhattan, and what should have been precipitated for many years is presented in a 140-minute movie. "in the artificial illusion, life gradually shows people the truth: every day is longer than a year, and the world is the corner."
