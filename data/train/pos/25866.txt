Sean. Pan and Nicole. Kidman's combination, what else can I say? Just like Sister Yu and Hugh. Jackman's performance in troubled Australia is as sophisticated as it is. The old drama bones are just different. The plot still continues to rise and fall, but there are still a lot of hard injuries in the plot. Not much, for the sake of shooting at UN headquarters, the real restoration degree is still very good. So three stars + one star = four stars. Above.
