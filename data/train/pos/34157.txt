I like it so much that I have a different impression of Toshihiro Yamashita. The ingenious interaction and clear atmosphere performed by the actors are very rich through multi-level design. Each smile inside is estimated to be stuck after the rehearsal, not responsible for the performance of the natural state, but to highlight the director's pure creativity extracted from the girl's daily life. Those narrow-angled booking lenses that surround the long lens all risk the charm of watching their own creation.
