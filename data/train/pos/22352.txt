@ Spazio Oberdan Milano is still bowie tribute, and it is strange that this biography has not become one of his well-known masterpieces. The film obviously has a high degree of completion, a good story and a first-class card, and Baoye is also very good at acting in Warhol. It is better to compare with the documentary made by radiant child. There are complementary and contrastive parts between the two.
