7.8 . The overall effect is not much different from that of the first film, but the special effects are even more outstanding. The narrative line was a little messy at first, but fortunately, it managed to get back to the main line. Although the plot is easy to guess, it is still moved. When watching the first film, I don't think Jin Xiang has good acting skills, but in this one, we can see her plasticity, which may be the reason why the character setting itself is also relatively plump. Overall, it's kind of interesting. It will be nice when the person I like can cooperate with he Zhengyu and Li Zhengzai.
