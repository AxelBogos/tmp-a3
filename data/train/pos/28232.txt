The lyrics and the plot and the perfect integration, the display of the first half of the life of the aunt, high tide, very able to capture the audience's impression, tower acting skills are so good, no wonder the aunt likes him so much. Show yourself in the eyes of your aunt, a talented musician, a child who lacks love, a tearbag wronged by a commission, a singer who pretends to perform with a smile, and a lonely person who is constantly betrayed. I had a different feeling that the story that killed me in my childhood and finally reconciled with myself was made by the director although it was old-fashioned.
