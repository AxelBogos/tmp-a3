During the seven days of Paterson, a company driver in the city of Paterson, the rules are full of micro-refinement, from the daily meaning to meet different people and things. Sometimes it's elegant, sometimes it's intense. Kumi wrote the whole film into his charming long story. In addition, I very much agree that "taking a bath in a raincoat is like taking a bath in a raincoat" is always a pity. Adam Driver is cold and humorous. Golshifteh Farahani, who plays the wife of the Heavenly School, is also very lovely.
