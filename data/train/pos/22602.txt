At first, it didn't feel right and awkward, and there were neither special effects nor gripping plots. But when I look back on it later, I suddenly find that the film reflects many of our real problems, class, prejudice, fantasy, conformism, dreamer and, most importantly, forgiveness. This kind of film belongs to the typical aftertaste type. If you stick to the story of the film, you will naturally be disappointed. The key is to extract the symbolic meaning.
