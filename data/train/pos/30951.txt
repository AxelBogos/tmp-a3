Everyone knows the way of enlightenment, and the difference between whether you are awakened or not actually depends on whether you can put it down. When you put it down, you will be aware of it, but you will never let it go. It is just unrepentant and willing to suffer. If you are unwilling to bear it, it may become karma.
