The film is very calm, no incitement, no impulse. When the director is dealing with it in daily life, he can let the audience slowly infiltrate and empathize with the characters. Cher's first film is really high, and the two crying scenes and Aunt Mei are better. Aunt May in the poster looks like Sophie Marceau.
