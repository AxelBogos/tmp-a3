This is a movie that immediately after I saw it, it was like shouting to tell the world that it was so fucking good! The love line between Andy Lau and Meng Jiahui is perfect! How to shoot a really delicate romantic emotion ah! I can't believe that a post-1995 generation fell in love with Andy Lau! What a lifetime series! All kinds of unexpected reversals in the plot! Ah, I love Johnnie to so much!
