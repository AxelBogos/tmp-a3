Special love stories of special characters in special times, special backgrounds, special places, a special era changed the fate of some people, led to the next series of special, at that time, everyone had to. There are very few films about the Kuomintang, and they still tell stories about comfort women. They look very fresh, feel touching after watching them, and calm down an hour later. Hou Xiaoxian's editing guidance makes the overall rhythm of the film very slow, and I like it very much. The last black-and-white photo is very moving. Chen Yihan Wanxi sacrificed a lot, but it was really beautiful. Chen Jianbin is really great. Compared with Ruan Jingtian, the protagonist is Ruan Jingtian. But it is obvious that the film is about the girls represented by Wan Xi and Chen Yihan, who are the real protagonists. Although they escaped the shells, they were destroyed by the war. At the same time, there are men from all over the country who speak with local accents but may never go home again. Chen Jianbin's sentence in the film: mother, I miss you. It's piercing. Dare to shoot this theme and pay tribute to Director Doudou. Personally, I think this is the most in-depth and best film. 8 points
