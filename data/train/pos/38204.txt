It has been brushed twice, for some reason, I forgot to mark it the first time, and I didn't have any impression on the plot. I felt more and more familiar with it when I began to watch it. Anthony, Geoffrey and Colin are all so handsome, three generations of handsome guys from the old, middle-aged and young people are playing on the same stage. Ah, especially Father Hopkins, the acting is so good! I just watched "Silent Lamb" yesterday, and I plan to watch "Hannibal" tomorrow. I feel that there is no discord between "psychic Detective" and these two films, just like a series.
