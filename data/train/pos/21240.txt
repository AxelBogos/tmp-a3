The reason for staying in this film is that the heroine, a virtuous lady, and those who "see the wind is rain" obviously have more to do with the maintenance of the family and the credit that appears to be the same. In the workplace failure, external private affairs is not the main reason, the nature of such debauchery, how to maintain a high degree of internal consistency. Time is of course the touchstone of character, and the understanding of betrayal is reflected incisively and vividly in the film from the perspective of the haunted lover.
