The whole play is good, and the plot is very attractive. At the end of the play, Tang Shanhai, Li Xiaonan and Chen Shen are all distressing, especially Chen Shen. It may be that I eat this person very much, and Li Yifeng's interpretation is very good. So much so that when I saw all his film and television works, including the powerful animal world, I also felt that Chen Shen was the best character. After all, my grandmother would shout Chen Shen when she saw him on TV.
