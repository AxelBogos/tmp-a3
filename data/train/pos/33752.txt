I saw the film when I was a child, and it was shocking. I bought a video disc two years ago, but I was still shocked. After reading Inoue Yasushi's original work the day before yesterday, I felt that the film sublimated the novel. The novel is too restrained. A film that surpasses the original and is greatly undervalued.
