Maybe I am old, and now I like this kind of sweet and masochistic love story. Guo Jingfei let me know that Su had nothing to do with appearance. Halfway through the movie, garlic cloves told me that the heroine's name came from Lei Jiayin, so in the second half, behind Dili Reba's beautiful figure, I always felt as if there was a big head (:
