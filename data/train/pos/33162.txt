A star was given to Zhang Hanyun and Dabao was electrocuted for the first time. A star for the song "first Love is not full", I like it very much. As for the two stars to Liu Juan, the film is very approachable, although I am post-90s, I also have a feeling. And the last star for my high school days. Although the film has a hard wound, its shortcomings outweigh its shortcomings.
