It is revisited after seeing Longmen Flying Armor, the former is dazzling stunts and countless secret weapons, blindly pursuing visual effects, but can not remember a classic character. The latter is down-to-earth or even simple hand-to-hand combat, but Wu Junru's funny, Hu Huizhong's heroic posture and Hui Yinghong's competitive character are all unforgettable. Sigh that the development of science and technology can allow Brother Chun to shoot a movie. I don't know if this is the sadness of martial arts movies. Classic, nothing but two words!
