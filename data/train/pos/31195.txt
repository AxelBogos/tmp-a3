This version is the first film about the list of gods that I saw when I was a child, so there are fans in it. I always thought that this was really the list of gods, and everyone acted vividly. Later, after watching the Legend of Nezha, I thought it was something. Until last year after the divinity list of the bishop. This is a fucking classic.
