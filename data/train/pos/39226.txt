19.3.14 @ Berkeley. The content of this film can be described perfectly by I beg you. When I hear "timid bird, I can't even say goodbye", my heart will tremble when I hear "lie lie it's a lie". The song I beg you sounds so primitive that it sounds like Sakura is questioning Shiro. It corresponds very well to the contradiction in Sakura's heart. On the one hand, she only wants Shi Lang to be by her side, on the other hand, she only wants Shi Lang to be by her side. In the real world, there is no drama of saving and being saved. I no longer believe that there is a drama of saving and being saved in this world, but I will still be moved by it when I see it, especially when it inevitably collapses.
