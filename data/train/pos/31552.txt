Favorite in childhood, one is Green Snake and the other is taking a bath. I especially like the scene in the bathhouse, and every character is brilliant. When I was a child, I liked the fat man who flushed Pavarotti. I thought the Chinese director was easy to fly at that time. In the last part of the big demolition in my sun, two men took pictures of the end of the 1990s in China with DVDs on small tricycles.
