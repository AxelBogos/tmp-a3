When you passed the square, a monkey with lipstick ran up to you and kissed you. When you got home, you told your girlfriend the truth and she smiled. One day, when you passed the park, a group of children with water cannons sprayed perfume on you. When you got home, you told your girlfriend truthfully that she was still smiling. Only one day your girlfriend found a pair of red underwear in the gap in the sofa! Besides, the bank bill is flying in, and you haven't spent the money at all.
