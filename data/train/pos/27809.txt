The best part from the beginning to the end, there is no silence, whether in Russia, Dubai or India, are exciting. I especially like the theme music of the Mission impossible series. When I think of it, I can't help but feel excited when I think of it. Finally, Tang Sao's appearance was particularly amazing, which may be a good impression left in the "Source Code". The only drawback is that the plot is too straightforward, but isn't that a little too demanding?
