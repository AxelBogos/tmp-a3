I love these amazing movies. I also like the sentence in a film review, "Life and death is really a little super Mary-life is: unhappy, walk, take gold coins, step on monsters." Death is: drilling pipes, all gray, keep walking, take gold coins, step on monsters. Ohh! The miracle of resurrection has happened! That is: drill out, dawn, but also have to walk, take gold coins, step on monsters â€¦... That makes sense!
