I just found out this movie today. To be honest, I don't know what standards Douban people have for the film, but I'm sorry to see the score of 5.5. Although this is a film introduced in 14 years, well, the publicity cover is also a lie, but I think this movie is really to my taste. I have suffered from so many bad movies in China. Although this film is not excellent, it is at least worth seeing.
