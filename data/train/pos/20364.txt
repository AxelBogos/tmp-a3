In fact, I don't like this story, it's too bloody, but I understand why I still quietly see the end of the story I don't like. Because it's so beautiful, when I saw "Hero" N years ago, I would say, at least the picture is very beautiful. But after seeing the works of Uncle Gong, I think that Master Zhang will not be able to shoot this kind of beauty in ten years. It is strange that handmade paintings are more fascinating than the famous mountains and rivers photographed.
