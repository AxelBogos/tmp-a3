When my aunt got on the bus leaving Shanghai and saw the prosperity of the big Shanghai, I suddenly realized how hard it was for a small potato to live in a big city full of material desires. At the end of the film, my aunt went to a small market to practice stalls, nibbling on a dry bun and eating pickles one by one on a cold day. Who could have known that she once went to college, spoke British English, loved Beijing Opera, and was able to make traditional Chinese painting. Spent most of her life in Shanghai. Life, ah, in the end should be ordinary, or to pursue vigorous?
