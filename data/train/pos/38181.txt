In other words, this film has to be big-name, big-name, forced, hot-blooded, hot-blooded, and it is absolutely conscientious to make it. Don't tell me that the scene is not big. The last part of the phalanx melee is definitely the best Spanish spear phalanx that I have ever seen.
Of course, European movies, as always, the artistic atmosphere is gorgeous, the complex oil painting texture picture, put aside the scene of the direct cosplay famous oil painting, not to mention a lot of other freeze-up pictures are oil painting level, okay?
