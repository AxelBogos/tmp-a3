I first watched Russell Crowe's remade version, and then watched the original version, I feel that each has its own wonderful. The remake is relatively fuller and more exciting in the plot of the film. The original version is brief and goes straight to the point, but the details are that when the hero's son pointed a gun at the man, the man sternly taught his son that the gun was very dangerous and should not play with it. This detail was deleted in the remake version. I think this is a better indication that the man is forced to take risks.

In short, both the original version and the remake version are very good-looking and wonderful films.
