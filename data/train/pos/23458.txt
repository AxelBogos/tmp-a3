I finished the film several years ago, and I finally saw it eight years after it came out. Narration and storytelling deepen the literary style of the film. The plot is very ingenious, simple but will make different people agree with different truth. It's good to express your love bravely, but if you know that some love is impossible to express, you should rest assured. I hope you and I can meet the one who can express and accept his love after going through many twists and turns.
