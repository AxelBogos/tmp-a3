It's by no means an ordinary monster movie. From this we can explore the root of Japanese national anxiety: between the unhostile natural disaster and the hostile enemy, Godzilla is such an existence with "objective hostility". Godzilla is the embodiment of this anxiety, and the origin of this anxiety is to some extent the demoralization of human civilization itself. They are afraid of their reason falling into madness. It's also valuable as a political comedy. Interesting little montage.
