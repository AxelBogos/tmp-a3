The fetters between parents and children are inseparable, eloquent, gentle but powerful. This is Ang Lee's film, although we can still see the childishness of the technique, but the tone of moving and shocking the audience in a slow rhythm has been established. Elderly people will shed tears when they see this film. In addition, the end result is indeed unexpected, but maybe life is constantly unexpected.
