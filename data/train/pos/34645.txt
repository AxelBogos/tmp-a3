In this series, I watched him grow up. He is fucking handsome. The characters are so straight! Liangkun is one of the brightest characters, and the later villains all praised that. He was a traitor, but the play was obviously not as good as Wu Zhenyu. Look at it again today, the ending turned out to be very funny.
