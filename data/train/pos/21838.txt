Anyway, in terms of the degree of terror, disaster + terror, the Deep Sea Crazy Shark, which can be used to mark shark fillets, is better than several blockbuster crocodile films in the past 20 years, such as "prehistoric crocodile" and "fleeing crocodile island". To be much more frightened, the background and scene of the story are approachable enough to frighten viewers in the hurricane zone of the United States. However, the speed of the woman's self-healing and the hardness of her skin is always a mystery. Before and after being bitten by three crocodiles, I didn't feel any harm. Finally, the Crocodile team in the film industry is very good, and the Sharks need to come on.
