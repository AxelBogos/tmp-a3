There is no complicated plot, a man, a dog, a father, a mother, a monitor, a boyfriend, a video account, just. The value lies in a person's growth, from meaningless to meaningful, from waiting to hard work, from depravity to success, the important thing is to establish goals and make unremitting efforts towards them. By the way, I can see the tension in Iraq and the mission of military dogs on the battlefield. In fact, it's only a few minutes. Sorry, spoiler. Another value of this film lies in love and emotion, communication between parents and children, communication between men and women, but these communications are defeated by the bond between people and dogs. Don't you realize anything? A dog who can only talk about barking conquers a woman who doesn't believe in the love of her parents and friends, and then they conquer each other. I wonder if it's because you talk too much when you don't establish a good relationship with another person.
