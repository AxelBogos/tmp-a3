The storyline is very simple, to survive the first 30 minutes, the shooting is not very good, a lot of superfluous lines and photography, as well as the poor performance of Rahel Weizs, destroy the conflict between moderation and self. Fortunately, the acting skills of Rachel McAdams, as well as the leading actor, have brought back some viewability. Rachel can be nominated for oscar, from blond plastic flowers to Jewish lesbians. It's amazing.
