This edition of Polo is really comfortable, humorous, wise and elegant. But what's the point of watching that scene secretly when Christina and Linda are on the way to paint? And the following reasoning is also exquisite, failure is also exquisite. Such a delicate and perfect crime relies too much on coincidences. It's a little unrealistic. It doesn't stand up to careful consideration. Three and a half stars.
