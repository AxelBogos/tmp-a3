How lucky the teenagers were to meet Mr. Keating at an age when they still had unlimited possibilities. The teenagers who are most impressed are the teenagers who rushed into the girls' classroom to read love poems, the teenagers who danced to the music on the rooftop, the teenagers who read poems and girls in the cave, the teenagers who were shy but most emotional, and the teenagers who found their true selves on the stage. A shining poem should be read to those who understand it.
