The feeling of this movie is really good, especially when I am watching JOKER, this one is simply changing my mood. The more the final case, the more heartache I saw. I didn't pay attention to the color kneading in the household before, but I thought she acted well. The arbitrary conclusion was: the hairstyle in the lottery looks good, and the situation is a bit like that of my high school head teacher.
