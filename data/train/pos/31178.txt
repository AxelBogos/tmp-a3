Making horror movies like Mad Max is Wen Ziren's skill! This is the only horror movie that can make me cry. It may be that the family is too poor, the exorcism couple may be too touching, or it may be too scary. The whole journey of high energy, one wave after another, really exciting, this is not a roller coaster, my ship is going to crash QAQ called Wen Ziren as a contemporary master of terror. It's like a tsunami.
