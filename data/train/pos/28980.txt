No, it's a movie you can watch. In fact, the leading role is not bad ~ it's just that the supporting roles are really good. ~ Liao Kaizhi and Mr. Kui Yong are the bright spots. ~ Yong you are so good. The performer is really good. As for Liao Kaizhi, as long as I have his time, my attention is on him.
