In fact, I like this kind of mindless thing best. Is there any! The last paragraph! Look at that crap! Look at all kinds of Flowers! Look at that plot setting! Look at that narrative! We'll know who it is! Is there any! That little girl in the third paragraph is so clever! The woman who appeared in two stages is very interesting. Tim Roth is still strange in yin and yang. The whole movie is a jerk! But that's how I appreciate it! What should I do?
