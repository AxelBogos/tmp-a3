The first half of the absurd comedy style is reasonable, while the warm style of the second half is not as good as that of the same type of years. Even the supporting actors are big names in Zhongwu Road (for example, the doctor who sells blood is the abnormal headmaster in Mo Yan's "melting pot"). He Zhengyu seems to be popular, and the little boy plays well and has a bright future. Although it is very different from Yu Hua's original novel, many details are still very compelling. He Zhengyu is quite cool, at least he has unique taste.
