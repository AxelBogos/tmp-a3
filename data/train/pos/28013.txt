At first I thought it was a criminal investigation suspense film, then it was a ghost film, then it was a zombie film, and finally it turned out to be a religious film. The taste is very strong, there are a lot of details hidden in the film, and the director successfully stunned a group of audiences.

Are the wizard and the Japanese old man an accomplice? Come on, give the microphone to the classmate next to you and say what you think.
