Every time I watch a movie, I always put myself in my shoes and think about what I would do if it were me. But this time I really didn't think about it. I wanted to live a good life with my uncle. I didn't want to destroy him, but I really didn't want to do it. She's really driving people crazy. Uncle acted so well that he saw a lot of helplessness.
