I began to agree: great filmmakers have been great since their debut. The creepy psychological film is the most modern in the series of Jin Min's works. The painting style is not yet crazy and haunted at the end of his career, but imagination and expressiveness (montage switching) have gone into an uninhabited land. Changing the point of view makes the audience feel the same way, so that they can't distinguish between reality and fantasy. After brushing four feature films, I decided that Jin Min was my favorite Japanese animation master.
