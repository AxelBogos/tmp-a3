It's a very Hong Kong quack movie. Young Carina Lau is really beautiful. Ah Liang is really not enough to get things done and looks angry without repentance. Fortunately, Hua Zai's appearance is supported (laughter). In a word, Hua Zai and Brother Fat, for a moment, are very much like Yifei and Brother Jin in Yang Dawen. I'm going to reread this article.
