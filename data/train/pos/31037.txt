"Let sorrow end at sunrise."
Music and Love
The music master Columbus fell into the abyss of loneliness because he lost his lover, and only music could let him see the "shadow" of his lover.
And his daughter Madeleine, who fell in love with his apprentice Malus, who pursued fame and fortune, was abandoned until her death.
Two people's insistence on love, although the result is separation, but the meaning is obviously different.
To treat the people we should love, we should love attentively all our lives, but for those we should not love, we should turn back as soon as possible.
In fact, compared to the love in the film, I pay more attention to the fact that Malus is dressed in . Wavy wig, charming lipstick, lace blouse, bow small leather shoes. (even prettier than the heroine )
