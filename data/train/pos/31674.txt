The film, which grossed more than $200 million at the global box office, tells the story of maids in southern towns who used their efforts to publish details of their lives with their employers during the civil rights movement. Although the face profile of the character is inevitable, the roles of Celia, a white woman, and Minny, a black maid, are amazing. No wonder they are both nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars, which is a bit like Precious's Mo'nique.
