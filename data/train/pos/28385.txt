The score is not very high. I really like the opposite play of Takuya Kimura and Yami Nagazawa. It is said that it is the work of Keigo Higano, although I haven't read this one, it's not bad. A small story composition, gradually restore the original appearance of the case, the end always gives each room paperweight shot a little deliberate ah, not so surprised. I think there must be three stars, plus one for the starring pair. Tut-tut, I don't know where to insert the beautiful straw.
