The art of travel is to break the shackles of time, go what you want, do what you want to do. A very literary film, lovely pictures, beautiful scenery, Parama rainforest, Colombian guerrillas, Pan American Highway, Mayan ancient city, Cusco, Bolivia, think of Connor only 20 years old, really do not want the years to grow old.
