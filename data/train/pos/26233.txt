Am I the only one who thinks the screenwriter of this film has a shadowy complex? The characters inside are talking about movies with their mouths shut. In addition to the Golden Jade League and the Twelve King Kong, the father also mentioned two horror movies to his son: fierce Ghost Street and fatal temptation. PS: this movie is so Korean TV series.
