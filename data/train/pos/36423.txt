After watching the ban on review in the media field, I just remembered today that the works were still good. In the limited space, the group play had a particularly wonderful ending, and the small reversal was also unexpected. Several scenes were called fun, Ben Fatso was still very good, and he jokingly asked me if I wanted to take a selfie this time.
