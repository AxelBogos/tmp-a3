The baggage in front of me was so great that I couldn't guess what the story was going to tell. As soon as I started filling the hole in the middle, I threw out a bigger burden (xx appeared). I thought the movie was shocking, so I could guess the ending. The ending was a little hasty, and the line of the blue army was not handled well, without the carnival sense of multiple lines crossing like Quentin. Looking at the special effects of 2003, domestic films are not a little behind. Come on!
