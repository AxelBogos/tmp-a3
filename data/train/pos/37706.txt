This hole is finally filled! This Christmas special is of long-lost quality. Although the ending for river is a bit hasty, you had a good time together without thinking about the library. When you opened the tenth season, there was still a picture of river on the doctor's desk. Your relationship is so special that it can't be measured by common sense.
