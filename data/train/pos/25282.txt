A side history of the United States, from Watergate to the legalization of same-sex marriage, is interpreted by famous actors. If you wear too much makeup, you can hide your acting skills and fail to produce the best actor and actress and supporting role. But Bell, Adams, Carell and Rockwell are all big stars I've seen many times. Back in the film, although the vice president is very resourceful and war hawk, he insists on her sexual orientation to withdraw from the presidential election for the sake of her younger daughter, and secretly supports her public opposition to same-sex marriage for her eldest daughter's career in politics. Complex human nature.
