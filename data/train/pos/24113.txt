Forty years ago classic movies, although the plot is very old-fashioned, but the degree of suspense is very good, soundtrack can also play a very good role! Hong Kong film really has its humorous place, especially the last part of the murder scene, Wan Ziliang was killed, slowly moving blood and saliva flew out together, which made me very happy!
