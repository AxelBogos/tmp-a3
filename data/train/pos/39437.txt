This piece is so awesome that there is nothing to say! Take a biography of Gideon and bring a semi-fictional person to life. The first half of the paragraph is a little strange and dull, ending half an hour, and the seemingly trivial contents of the narrative are finally strung together to discuss life and death. It is also a brilliant comedy performance, funny in face but serious or sarcastic in fact.
