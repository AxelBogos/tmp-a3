I have always admired Paganini's musical achievements and have found many versions of biographies to excavate this master. Later, after seeing the film, I didn't talk about the plot for a while, in which David Garrett showed Paganini's acting personality incisively and vividly! The only disadvantage is that he is too healthy and handsome.
