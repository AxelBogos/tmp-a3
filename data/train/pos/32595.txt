Under the still high standard of photography, this season seems to have been trying to imbue viewers with a message of darkness and despair, especially in episode 9 Heroic. As if eating chronic poison, constantly eroding the body and mind. But the hope of the last three episodes is like an antidote, especially in the last half hour of the season finale, which makes people scared and trembling nervously. finally, the characters in the play and the audience in front of the screen are saved.
It has to be said that the writers and directors are very good at controlling the emotions of the audience, and after suppressing 33 episodes, the outbreak of the final episode of the season came like a flood. Presumably the audience who did not abandon the show must have had feelings for this modern apocalypse episode and had a deeper insight. See you next year.
