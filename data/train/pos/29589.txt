Joaquin is amazing. In the screen, he is joker himself. There are not only several scenes honoring the appearance of "Taxi driver" de Niro, but also the surprise of the film "the Joker" created for dc after Nolan's "the Dark Knight." maybe because the director and writer want to explain too many causes and consequences in the film, they are bound to the propositional composition. Unfortunately, it did not exceed expectations to achieve a pattern and depth comparable to the classics.
