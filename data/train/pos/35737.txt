I read the original work again on the train and went back to the dorm to watch the movie again. I like the feeling of this movie very much. although it is an American movie, it is full of British fans. And what a great casting! It makes people want to try to read all six of Austen's novels, although (Pride and Prejudice) has never read more than half of them.
