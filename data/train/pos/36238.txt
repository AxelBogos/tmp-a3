I just saw the title and thought it was Japanese-style Mary Su who hurt eggs again. I glanced at the introduction of Douban and was a little interested to have a look at it. After watching it, I'm glad I didn't miss such a good movie. There are not many excellent movies with style, acting, appearance, ideas and power.
