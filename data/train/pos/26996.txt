Kyu Tanaka's Yan Yi is really outstanding. The small expressions of loyal dogs in the year are so cute that the mood of waiting for confirmation before and after a kiss is like a dog wagging its tail and begging for love. It can be seen that it has nothing to do with gender, what matters is the happiness and stability with the person you like. Although the minister of the girl's heart is also very cute. =
