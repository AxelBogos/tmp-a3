The theme of marrying a woman, which is also starring Li Zhi, is much richer than the character and plot of late Spring, but the slow and delicate emotional excess is also obscured by a more brisk narrative. Zhima Iwashita, who plays his daughter, is very beautiful, but the character is much thinner than the daughter in Yuejiazi's late Spring.
