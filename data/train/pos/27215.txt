In the most beautiful episode of the trilogy, Sam Remy uses the techniques of the first episode more naturally and smoothly, and some elements of black humor make people laugh. The whole is not only a better creative version, but also can be seen as the "hardcover" of the first episode. It ends with the story of "Heroes of the Devil World", but it is not as enjoyable as this episode.
