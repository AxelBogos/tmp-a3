The story is very strong, not by the vulgar way of scaring people by background music, but by real bloody pictures to create a sense of horror. Anyway, I got a chill on my back after reading it. And the psychology of watching the film is also changed from the grass mud horse at the beginning to the "live chicken" at the end of the film. Anyway, it's just good-looking. It's worth watching twice. I don't dare to travel to Thailand any more.
