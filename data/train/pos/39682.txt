The degree of reduction of the film to the original work is still quite high. Maybe everyone who has seen the original work enters the cinema with a critical eye. When the little Harry Potter with round glasses appeared, almost everyone immediately recognized him as Harry Potter. And Ron Hermione, the whole production is very careful. I really hope we can take our own works so seriously.
