Unexpectedly, the heavy and slow lens, the classical romantic soundtrack and the Amazon adventure go so well. The motivation to reshape the lintel / the obsession of a pair of dreams / the unretreating soldier / the fantasy experience of the jungle / the deep affection of the family all come slowly in a calm and strange rhythm. He came back a little unprepared for the first time, and then felt as if he had found a rhythm and felt him go out again and again. Thank you pcc! Prefer witches and lens design.
