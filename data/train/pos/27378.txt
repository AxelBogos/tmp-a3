"I am a Legend" is another moving film, which is heavier than "Dawn of the living Dead". I can't help thinking that if one day, everyone around me will die or become zombies, leaving you alone in the barren city during the day, looking for food and supplies, listening to the cries of zombies after sunset and going to sleep, day after day, when it will end. After the death of the dog, the man also gave up hope, but fortunately the woman appeared in time to save the situation.
