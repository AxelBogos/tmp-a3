The fact that the two powerful men are gay together is a huge attraction in itself. Moreover, Guo Tianwang and Wang Qianyuan really lived up to expectations, with a tacit understanding and a clear sense of attack and acceptance, especially Guo Tianwang, who was impressive at the beginning of hiding the body, but I saw it fragmented for some indescribable reasons in the second half of the movie. I didn't pay much attention to the plot, so I was not very impressed. I only remember the feeling of happiness.
