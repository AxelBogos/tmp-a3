In this world of bad movies and as Zhang Jiahui's debut film can be said to be very great. The story is not bad, although some of the shots are not clear, but the whole story is very complete and clear. As a debut, we can see that Zhang Jiahui is trying to tell a story, and the film is not difficult to understand. The film draws a lot of lessons from classic movies, such as the Exorcist and the Spirit. As the first film director, it is worth encouraging.
