The scene of teacher Sullivan teaching Helen Keller to eat with a knife and fork left a deep impression on me. At first, I didn't know what they were doing. I saw the two of them entangled there all the time, with a long shot and description. I finally realized that she was teaching Helen to eat. I have to admire their performance.

What impressed Helen most was that when Helen wanted to say "Water" by the well, she really understood what teacher Sullivan was doing, teaching her spelling, teaching her to feel the world, and the logic and connection. She finally understood that teacher Sullivan was teaching her to learn and to know the world. Because for a blind, deaf and dumb person, she did not know why she did it like training animals, but instinctively compromised and obeyed. This time she really understood and felt as if she had suddenly awakened. I'm so happy for her.

It just feels like Miss Sullivan and Helen's father are a little facial.
