It turned out to be an adaptation of a real event. Before that, the words of the "great dictator" brought by Chaplin were still ringing in our ears. A few years later, the "Mr. Verdu" just after World War II was full of Chaplin's desperate accusations of society at that time, and it was always a single person who was responsible for the crime. However, as for the United States, World War II made it full of gold foil, and the money washed away the cruelty and compassion of the Great Depression, so that the empathy of the film could not be fully demonstrated.
