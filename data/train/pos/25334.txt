In addition to all kinds of "rebellion", the film is actually a film about finding self-worth and meaning. Although the expression of the whole film is surrealism, the setting of the characters reveals a kind of realism all the time, so it is very critical. The end of the film has a strong religious color, but it also reflects that contemporary people hiding in the illusory world is the last destination of dystopias.
