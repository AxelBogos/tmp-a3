The film basically tells the truth that man will prevail over nature. Wensheng was eliminated early by society because of his bad genes and reached the peak of his life with his indomitable will. In sharp contrast, Geron and Anton are genetically excellent and gifted. One fell on the steps of self-esteem, and the other succumbed to society. Vincent's success is more inspirational than the story of an ugly duckling turning into a white swan. Who can feel his hardship?
