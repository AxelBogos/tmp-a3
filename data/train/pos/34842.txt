This year's mainland film is the best and most surprising hope for making Chinese genre films. Come on. Ps: recently, I worked as an intern in the Procuratorate. Although the subject matter of Luo Shengmen is very common. But in the end, the sublimation of fatherly love is very good, and it also discusses the popular crime of the rich second generation. It's a very good script. Continue to praise a bad director. Ps: those who comment on anything as long as it's Aaron Kwok's bad movie, can you stop being so stupid? You have the evaluation of the movie.
