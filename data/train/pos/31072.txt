Living in a vacuum makes it easier to see the essence of life. Many of the pictures are very similar to the commercials that Yuan Yanzai shot for MUJI to go to a certain salt sea in South America. Japanese aesthetics has a good experience in this film. For example, "give up", suitcase, glasses lost, will not try to find, the owner can still be safe. Less is more. There is logic behind things, so there is no need to force them.
