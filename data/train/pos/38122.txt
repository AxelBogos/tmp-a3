To put it bluntly, a few dialogues about religion are very interesting. Turkey as a multi-ethnic integration, multi-religious and cultural collision with a special geographical location, coupled with the once mysterious Ottoman Empire as the background, the film still has a lot of highlights. Unfortunately, the scenery and the face of the protagonist are more impressive than the plot with the theme of fraternity in Western countries.
