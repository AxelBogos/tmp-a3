For knight-errant, the best ending is nothing but discouragement or great enlightenment to bring beauty home, that is, the so-called "always remember the rivers and lakes to return to the white hair, want to return to heaven and earth into the boat." As Jianxin said, no matter how good one is at swordsmanship, the changes of the times can not be decided by one person, let alone bear the happiness of everyone, all you can do is to protect the specific happiness in front of you. Thank you, and I'm sorry. Bye.
