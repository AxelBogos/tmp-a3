The anti-war sentiment of the whole film is very strong in the second World War film made by the Germans. The focus is not on the war, but on depicting the great transformation of several major characters from their arrival in Stalingrad to the whole outlook on war and outlook on life. Every scene is just right for 140 minutes, and the photography is also good. In short, the madness of the last few characters, suicide and so on, like the Deer Hunter, is a profound torture of World War II. 4.5 stars.
