The film censorship system of the Republic of China did not allow strange forces and chaos. I appeared in the film industry because I was vain and wanted to use the mouth of a ghost to say things that people can't say. Revenge aside, this kind of ironic lines are still worth thinking about. Lin Xinru's acting skills are a little bit powerful, and the reversal plot of the story is also unexpected, although the ending is a little bit bloody, but the thrilling special effects of ghost movies scare me.
