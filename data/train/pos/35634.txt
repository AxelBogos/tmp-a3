For the first time since the Communist Party of China, it did not belittle the Japanese army or vilify the national army, but objectively photographed the war in Taierzhuang, extolled the bravery and sacrifice of the anti-Japanese soldiers, and saw the flag of the Republic of China (China) flying over the city of Taierzhuang. I can't help but feel excited! Salute to the revolutionary martyrs!
