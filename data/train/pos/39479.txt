The Journey to the West in my heart has never been a dream journey of harmony and deep affection between master and apprentice. The three monstrous apprentices are too much in my heart, perhaps due to the consideration of the large screen audience, there is no way to be darker. The skills of Lao Chuang and Zhou Xingchi are still profound and amazing, and their courage to deconstruct the Journey to the West is commendable. Sun WuKong, whom I want my son to know, must not be a hero on earth, he is just an alien with inner demons inside and strong enemies to resist on the outside.
