On August 1, 2014, this is not a tragedy of a midlife crisis, it is a tragedy of self-fulfilling failure, and when it hits a brick wall in the outside world, the people closest to you become a dustbin of negative emotions. At the time of making this film, there was no word "to be a girl", but Kate was just a girl, herself and the person around her. Marriage should not be a safe haven, nor should it be an escape from life, nor should it be moving to Paris.
