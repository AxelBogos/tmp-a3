Circumferential multilinear narration. It is true that there are many feature films of this type, but it is tricky to compete with each other. There are a lot of losers in the story. The ending echoes well, if the circle is missing, the film will be corny, although the narrative mode itself is becoming stereotyped. The soundtrack stepped on well, driving the rhythm of the whole film.
