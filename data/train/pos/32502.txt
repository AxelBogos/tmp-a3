Los Angeles, Novina Rhett is so cute. In New York, Uncle Fried Chicken was so handsome when he was young. He had no idea that he was cute, impatient and a bit of an idiot. Paris, I really think the blind sister is very cool. Rome, talkative sunglasses, you refresh my views on that. Helsinki finally sat in the snow and looked so helpless. A group of ordinary people can no longer be ordinary, in the words of meeting in the middle of the night, flashing lonely, beautiful, warm and dazzling light.
