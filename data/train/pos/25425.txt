The story of the astronaut was interesting, but a little out of touch with reality; the story of Huppert was so boring that there were holes in the performance that could not hide the script; the story of the disabled was supposed to be the best, but the director was so high that he simply showed the embarrassment of the small potatoes and did not care about their hearts. The overall control is very good, and the camera is quite restrained, which is really appropriate in the night of a bad cold.
