It's quite real. It hurts a little bit after reading it. Which unforgettable love is not an act? When angry, regardless of wanting to jump off a building and want to crash, I wish I could hold each other even if I was dragged away when I regret it. This kind of heart-wrenching love, once in life is enough. The one with the clothes, it's funny.
