I think I should have seen it before. To be honest, the acting skills of Li Bingbing and Zhou Yumin are not good. Really, the dialogue between them is very stiff and fake. I found that the title of the film is called linger, and I think this expression is more appropriate, so apart from love, I prefer to understand this film as how to find myself, how to find some answers in the drifting of past and present, memories and reality.
