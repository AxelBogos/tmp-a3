It is difficult to comment, but it is quite different from the original. After watching the movie, I can better understand some of the emotions that the novel wants to express. The hero of the movie is very good at excusing himself. Then, why is there Kagawa Koji here? it's so interesting. I feel more acting than in Japanese TV dramas. Ps foreigners think that transnational development is too suitable for the role of mute! XD
