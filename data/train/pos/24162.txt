In this film, Zhang Guoli's emphasis and performance feel very much like Chen Jianbin. Wow, Mr. Zhang, who has been around for 00 years, is still very charming. Remember that line: when you were young, you didn't have the courage to be a thief; when you are old, you have the courage to be a thief, but the thief is gone. Personally, I can accept this way of life.
