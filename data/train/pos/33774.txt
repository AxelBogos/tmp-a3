People are forced out, the pleasure of making money.
Live for yourself.

If you can make money, it's kung fu! freaking awesome.
Market economy, the market speaks.
The law of the jungle is the law of the jungle. I give up on them. It's best to socialize.
This way I am the most comfortable.

I'm alone. I can pretend to be all right. I did it for myself.
Form this good habit. Rivers and lakes.

Enjoy yourself, fight, and that's it. It's a good habit.
