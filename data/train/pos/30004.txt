What do you mean by growing up? The smile began to converge, the chin grew a beard, the height became very tall, no longer wishful thinking. It's not growing up, it's getting old. Growing up is when you look back at a movie ten years later and think of something old and understand something new. And when the movie ends, it will still be as tearful as it was ten years ago.
