Under a bad regime, there will be a bad Oedipus family structure. A bad regime will also cover up its sins with brilliance and look for accomplices in the name of unity; just like the hostess sacrificing other people's children to protect her own children, and then sacrificing her own children to protect herself (cold war, exclusivity); just like every Chinese household goes into the eyes of money, then play! Sadly, the woman (negative government), she is at a loss in the face of evil!
