I just finished watching it in iqiyi. Not bad. Jackie Chan's play has always been perfect. Jackie Chan is also old, but as long as Jackie Chan's movies will support it. After all, it is also a legend and a youth. Luo Zhixiang is really interesting, and Ouyang Nana's acting is not so bad. Not bad. Keep to the rules.
