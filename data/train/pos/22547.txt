A typical American action movie. The reversal of the plot can no longer attract more popularity. However, the relaxed humor of Bruce and the humming songs of Moscow taxi drivers are very interesting. You can go to the cinema to see the big scene of car overturning and fierce fighting. For me, who likes muscle men, it's very cool.
