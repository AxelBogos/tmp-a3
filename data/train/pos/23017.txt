In fact, this ordinary assassination is also the result of a joint action by anti-Japanese resistance groups of different factions (the interim government of Kim Ju and the martyr regiment of Kim Yuan-feng). At the end, the members of the pro-government and martyr regiment celebrated their return and Captain Lian was released, because the real anti-Japanese volunteers, such as Kim Ku died in assassination, Kim Yuan-feng died in Kim Il Sung's purge. And countless traitors like Captain Lian escaped punishment because of the protection of the new government.
