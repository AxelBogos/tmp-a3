It really makes people look physically uncomfortable. It's a little nauseous. The movie seems to take a knife and cut open the woman's past bit by bit, and finally really. Even though she has grown up and has a lover with a prosperous life and career, I still feel sorry for her and weep for her from the bottom of my heart. The last question was not enough, but she finally plucked up the courage to face the truth and face the hurt she had suffered, and finally wanted to hold both of them together, and everything would be all right.
