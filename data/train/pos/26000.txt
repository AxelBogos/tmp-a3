I was interrupted after watching it three times, and I didn't see the end until the last time. This kind of film is still the funniest to watch with people, even if it's a hungry dregs projection. Coquettish, wave, cheap, stupid, cute, dirty joke king, the most atypical anti-hero in history, complaining about the creator, complaining about the movie, breaking the fourth wall, flashback, very pornographic and violent. I wonder if the sequel can come up with more new tricks.
