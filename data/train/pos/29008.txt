The first part of 20140111jtl's mother's castle must be seen together. Childhood anecdotes in the bright sun, prose narration, narration, typical French warmth and humor, great love. Many things in the film, I had a similar experience in my childhood, so it resonates very much. In childhood, everyone may feel that his father is omniscient and invincible, and it is only when we find that this is not the case that we really begin to grow up.
