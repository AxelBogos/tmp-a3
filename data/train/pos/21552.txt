Montgomery's pride and arrogance cost the allies and even Dutch civilians dearly, but the allies had plenty of time. And the Germans, who did their best for the last fight, had no time to celebrate. The so-called victory is just a flashback before dying. The stubbornness and rigidity of the British are maddening. This star-studded drama is so serious that it is of great significance, just as the mention of Pearl Harbor first thinks of "Tiger" rather than "Pearl Harbor".
