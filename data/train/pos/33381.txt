After class in the evening, I hurried home to watch this movie because it was raining today. The conservative and humble young girl, who can't read but can read pictures, is sometimes full of emotion and sadness for her master's painting. She can see the colors other than white in the clouds but cannot see a happy future with her master-art born in sorrowful love is the most touching. That part of the mouth, it's so beautiful!
