The lonely old man looks back on the past with a tolerant and calm heart when his life is coming to an end, talking about the process of self-reflection and self-redemption. The narrative technique of the combination of dreams and memories, the philosophical reflective summary of life, and the prose style, warm, relaxed but profound.
