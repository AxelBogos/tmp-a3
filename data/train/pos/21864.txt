I built the moonlight the night before we parted in the park I built for you. Whenever the park lights are on at night, I am the one telling the whole city that I am thinking about you. Our separation was a misunderstanding. When I knew that you really loved me and I just didn't know how to express it directly, it was too late that night. The park lights will never come on again.
