The picture is quite beautiful. Agnes has a magnanimous husband, a cousin who loves her, and Marcus, who admires her. Why not be satisfied? Grandma's skirt contains everything like a safety barrier to escape pain. My mother, Marcus and Young all died, and my heart was breaking. All kinds of psychological experiences of Oscar children, bodies and teenagers. Children's perspective reflects the repression of life before the war, the cruelty of the war, the persecution of Jews, the tragedy after the defeat, and so on.
