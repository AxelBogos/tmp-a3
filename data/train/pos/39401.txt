Every chill that spreads through the muscles and skin is a warning from God when you steal the forbidden fruit, and you have anticipated the calmness and happiness of the rest of your life. It may be the tragic and fateful "Qin", or the miraculous performance of Diane Lynn, or it may be that the evocative feelings are so wanton that they were once so deeply immersed in them that they could not extricate themselves. Devil, your name is bewilderment.
