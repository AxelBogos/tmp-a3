As calm and powerful as ever, the second act "interrogation" is one of the most impressive scheduling scenes of the year. The historical burns of this scene accurately and finely reveal fresh and hot blood-spurting wounds. By comparison, the final "trial" courtroom scene is a little light. Bigelow is still praised for her prudent values in dealing with history, and you can feel the composure of falling to the slightest detail in the image.
