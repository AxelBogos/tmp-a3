The typical Bergman style of despair and indifference is still a cruel insight into the intimacy of the world. Starting from the Mask, I deeply feel that Bergman has completely poured all his pain into his film characters without reservation. The pain is so publicized and naked that it makes people feel like a pain in the throat but indulge in it.
