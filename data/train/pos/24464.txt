It's so hard. It took me many days to finish it. Bad love makes beauty ugly. It is the first time to find that a bully CEO can have a negative impact in this way. He always has Yingying and Yanyan. His halo of talent makes people prejudge and ignore your talent. Your infatuation and devotion to sculpture are just ludicrous peach news in the eyes of others. It's so sad. Especially think of historical archetypes. The real woman who died of old age in an insane asylum.
