There are few films that pay attention to the friendship between women, so each one is very precious to me. The story itself is very moving, the two heroines are also very beautiful, as far as the film itself is concerned, the structure is somewhat stiff and strange. All kinds of weird language switching, too weird. It might be better to get rid of the modern and ancient interludes and directly film the ancient story.
