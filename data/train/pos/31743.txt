When I saw this movie for the first time in high school, I hadn't seen it for a long time. I always wanted to review the movie. The poop slide in the park, the pool swallowed the bento bought by my brother, and my sister hurried to the neighbor Obasan's house when she met the bad guys. I really want to see it.
