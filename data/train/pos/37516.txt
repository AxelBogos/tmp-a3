Like the implicit elegance of British films, lines mixed with bitter satire, in fact, the intention is to express softness and kindness. It doesn't have to be too complicated. Feel it with your heart. The worry of the young man next door, the rare beauty and warmth of the sunshine in England, and the chic gardening and panoramic scenery outside the house and balcony all add color to the film.
