It is really beautiful to be able to reach the classicality in the post-modern context where individualism prevails, which makes people burst into tears. The lines and performances are too good to be picky, and the montage is sometimes mischievous and sometimes serious and interesting. At first, the black people who can only appear below the neck are prickles, enrich the details of "Lincoln" and are more powerful than many branch lines. In the end, Lincoln died as a mortal, but it made him more noble: we no longer have excuses for being mortal but unable to do so.
