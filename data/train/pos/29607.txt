Some unexpected narrative perspective switching techniques, very good. The atmosphere is also great, and the first-person perspective reminds me of some of the old horror puzzles I played when I was a child. The shape of the transformed person is full of bad taste. In addition, the gray texture of the picture matched the story and the environment, and I saw that in the end I was completely committed to it.
