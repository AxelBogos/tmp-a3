What a wonderful movie I saw this morning! It was supposed to be familiar with this kind of movie with key words such as suspense, thriller, car racing, firefight and so on. Unexpectedly, the hard shell is wrapped in a loving heart, which makes people warm and moved. Especially starring Kevin. Costner is old but still handsome, this kind of man is brave and affectionate, it is hard to give up.
