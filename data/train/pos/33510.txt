Ten years ago, the title was Yossi & Jagger. Ten years later, the title was Yossi. The title of the translated film at that time certainly did not expect to make the second film, but when the second film was released, the free translation title seemed to be superfluous.

I watched one or two films together, and I always thought that only in this way could I be considered a complete movie.
