The most beautiful and treacherous actors weave the most absurd spring dreams, making the people in the dreams sprout the stupidest, most fragile and most moving love of butterflies. This trembling love exists because of deceit, because of betrayal and deep, standing on the difference, dying in dignity, complex and pure, beautiful and empty. So this story will probably allow me to think back for several years.
