Still the same director, but more remake is really progress, the story is much clearer than before, is no longer a confusing narrative, the shape and spirit of this kind of memories can fully understand the meaning, not procrastination. And to tell you the truth, the American version of the curse is far more frightening than the original Japanese version, and the degree of surprise is far better than before. I feel scary and exciting when I see it. Don't give five stars because Jiaoko is too ugly!
