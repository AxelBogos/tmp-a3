I don't know why this kind of film with a sense of time always touches me a lot. With the passage of time, I have been obsessed with time. I think the part of burning books is very good, but there is no dialogue, but it is better than a thousand words. The set is not bad, otherwise if you look at Dorian Gray's portrait, you will know what is really cheap texture. Please pay attention to the plot, although I also watched 11 very acting â€¦ The image of beard has always symbolized pseudo-morality in this subject matter.
