The western United States in the 19th century gave people a concept of gunfight violence. There are always thugs who want to get something for nothing, bully men and women to seize wealth, cowardly people can only let it go, and vengeful people treat each other with all their heart and will never be slaughtered! The ending always belongs to the side of justice.
