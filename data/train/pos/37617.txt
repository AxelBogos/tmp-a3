I haven't seen a play like this for a long time. Qing Xuan has a bad motive but has acquired the skill of being born, while Fujimi is a tragedy, which is not taken advantage of by the triple love. This play can be listed in the same list as the veteran Wei Rong Feng post and the Koga Rong method post ^ _ ^ ps: it turns out that there is the great god Kawajiri.
