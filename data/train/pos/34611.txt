The storyline is out of order. I don't understand it at all. The storyline is basically 2 stars. However, anyone who can score rationally after watching this film is also impressed. I am a mentally retarded licking face coaxed by this kind of pure fans. I can only score 5 stars without a brain! In the end, the Paris Tower wedding light fireworks show cost too much money, and party Wolfgang contributed the hottest part of the show!
