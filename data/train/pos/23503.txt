It is a lot of fun to start with a pseudo-documentary and finally uncover the truth through the series of three psychic stories. The highlight of the film lies in the performance of the characters in a state of fear, and the small-cost and smart way to create a scary atmosphere through the strange effects of objects in a particular environment. The overall feeling is very similar to the kind of strange childhood dreams with a circus, and the nightmares that once could not be let go are the root causes of ghosts.
