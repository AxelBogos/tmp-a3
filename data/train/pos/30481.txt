You can't be wrong to trust snyder! Sure enough, as cavill said, the film is completely snyder's child, and you can see the manuscript of the cartoon at every mirror. OOC? No problem, what is shown here is the growing kal-el/clark at a loss and unprepared period. There is no one zod villain of the year. I didn't see the Nolan powder blowing wayne's satellite, but it was an unexpected surprise to see lexcorp's tanker.
