ðŸ’® was born sorry from Ye Zang, Matsuko Yuko and Yizi continue the interpretation of "A life doomed to failure anyway". Yizi is not sympathetic at all, but I like her change the most. She doesn't think she found herself in boxing, but she doesn't give up on herself. I miss my sophomore boxing class very much. In fact, I think it is my most talented sport.
