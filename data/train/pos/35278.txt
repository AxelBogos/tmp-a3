This is supposed to be one of Master Woody's best movies. It is a perfect fit for such a story to be narrated in the form of a documentary. Zerig's life is presented in the way of video recording, which makes the whole film look like a case treatment document with a great sense of reality. Can be described as the perfect unity of form and content. Many details in the film reflect the consistent style of Master Woody, such as Jewish identity, crowd effect, Nazi, psychology, religion, childlike interest and imagination. Through the story of Zerig, it is also a consistent style of Master Woody to continue to satirize the hypocrisy and absurdity of the adult world. Dr. Eudora's dedication to love is interspersed with the description of the story, which shows the extraordinary literary skills of director Woody. Finally, I would like to say that although I have seen so many Woody movies, this one still impresses me. Ten points.
