Jamie Donan is the hero of the siege of Yadowell! I saw "50 Shades of Grey" on the 2nd and "siege" on the 11th, but I didn't even see it. Fortunately, I still like him so much, and I also like the heroine Dakota, just because I like it. I was moved by the scene after the Gray helicopter disaster and the proposal. Porn is not very important in this movie. Of course, there are still many tricks for the director. I just want to see the love play. But Gray's beard doesn't shave. Anna's face is swollen.
