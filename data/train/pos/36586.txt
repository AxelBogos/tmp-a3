I'm so nervous! After reading it, my palms are sweaty! It's so cute! The mother of the leopard died, and Bangui became a father to take care of the four cute little leopards, fighting evil black wolves, fighting big brown bears, raging out the eagles and scaring the owls away. Finally, the baby leopard was successfully returned to the father leopard ~ the baby leopard was picked up like a toy. Why are you taking such a great picture? Full score recommended! I was touched to death.
