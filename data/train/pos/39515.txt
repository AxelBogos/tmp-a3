This film is in great contrast to the return, which loses the pure nature of the former and looks so false and affected.
The performances of several old people stand the stability and thickness of the film. Especially the old Zhaodi, as a wife and mother, is so real. Endless thoughts and grief for her husband, worry about her son. Parents are worried when their children travel thousands of miles.
In contrast, Zheng Hao's role is distorted a lot, because he is just a good memory image, focusing on all the good thoughts.
The young Zhaodi, played by Zhang Ziyi, has such a good look in her eyes, as well as the posture of running several times and the braided hair that jumps when she runs. The last scene has the texture of an oil painting. Has been running, has been following the shadow of her husband.
This is the most favorite film I have ever seen by director Zhang Yimou. It is a simple and real emotion. The details also contain the changes in the lives of ordinary people in the times, such as the posters of the Titanic, the villages where labor is lost, and so on.
