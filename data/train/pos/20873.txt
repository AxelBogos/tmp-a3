This film belongs to the typical Chow Xingchi style, but also mixed with some different characters, formed a typical Hong Kong film at that time, or quite happy, in which Sammi Cheng is very bright and beautiful; and the little girl who bought egg tarts is also cute enough; the several appearances of the head of long five are also very funny, and a play between Shu Qi and the male master feels general, and this film is relaxed enough and good enough.
