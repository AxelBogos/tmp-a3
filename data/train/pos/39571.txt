Yu Lian is a portrait of Stendhal, the author of the novel, and the plot of the film is based on a real event of Stendhal's time. Stendhal, who participated in the Napoleon regime, worshipped Napoleon and recognized the concept of freedom, equality and fraternity in the French Revolution. In the face of that magnificent era, Stendhal had a lot to say. Stendhal is good at psychological description, but the wonderful psychological description in the novel is difficult to be fully displayed in the film.
