TRUEMAN's ironic name, his world is a completely fake and manipulated world. I like the last part when he hammered the wall. And I hate the first half of the film very much. I've already made it clear that it's Reality Show, but it looks too much like a movie. There are too many unreasonable shots. The film began to get interesting after Kirstow appeared.
