A wonderful film, the story takes place in a small studio, that is, the performance of a radio play, can continue to have problems, each problem is also full of humor, and finally push the story to a dead end. and lead the movie to the best part. There is almost nothing dull in the whole story, and each character's personality is plump through limited performance. It's really a very happy work.
