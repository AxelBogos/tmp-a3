Holstrom-style "grow up" tragicomedy. The growth in the fantasy + the innocence in the mirror + the magic life flow. Children's perspective is similar to Leonardo's mentally retarded in A different Sky, and so is the death of his mother. Quote the dream of a spaceship in the name of the puppy Leica. An endless roof. The sexual enlightenment of nude models. PS: I love such a little magic, and my imagination is as sharp as Louis Mahler's curiosity.
