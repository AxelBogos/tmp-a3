I remember a group of people in the circle at that time, and everyone said they were going to make a movie. But five or six years later, everyone went their separate ways, and only Brother Zhou really made his own movie. I gave Snow Mountain, his second commercial film, a five-star rating, not only because I liked the end of the film, but also because of the dream of my youth, which had been gradually forgotten by several of us. He's the only one who insists.
