BMY, I haven't really been touched by a movie for a long time. The first half of the narration and flashback narration are actually a little messy and loose. The second half of the paragraph describing the change of mother's attitude towards her boyfriend is very delicate, but it is still a bit slow compared to the short play after waking up. Everything else is very good. This ending is actually an eastern compromise, and there is no need to make it clear that there is always a process, and it is not easy for two souls who are so similar to come together. In fact, boys' feelings are like this, ah, in good times, they can do whatever they want with each other, when they are light, they may not even want to say a word, everything is hidden in their hearts, and they will be born after a long time. At this time, it is necessary to rebuild the bridge between feelings and trust, and one side can be saved by taking the initiative. After all, there is always that person in the heart, the past bit by bit can not be easily forgotten, but experienced so many hardships, we will be at a loss in the face of the future. Only by being with you for a long time can you keep each other warm and walk into your heart again. Even if the four seasons reincarnation, you know, I am still that person, never changed.
