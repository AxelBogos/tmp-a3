For more than 30 percent of one or two stars, I also have to give four stars! There is no reference to Need for Speed's four stars, otherwise, this film will be given seven or eight stars! The title of the film is too easy to be misunderstood, just like the panting at that time! As a matter of fact, Old Joe has been very good in recent years, and his films are all unambiguous! Personally, I think that the intention of this film is very obvious, that is, I want to say that their old American hair has made a contribution in this area! But it is, isn't it?
