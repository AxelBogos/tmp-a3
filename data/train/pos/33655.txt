It's a great youth movie, a veritable classic. The whole film has almost only a few scenes, and the cost should be very low, but it is definitely a good film, which is the strength of the creators. It was horrible that PS:Allison was finally turned into that ugly look. Andrew and Brian were stunned. What kind of aesthetic?. The haircut and costume in front of you cried, okay? PPS: the director is actually the director of Spring is not a Reading Day.
