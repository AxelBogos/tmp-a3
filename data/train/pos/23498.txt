I knew it was Boss as soon as I made my debut, and I didn't need a spoiler. The main plot can not be weaker, the last 5 minutes is too tearful. When the moonlight of the ghost beam thousand fathom sounded, there were some tears accompanied by those memories. It's been 10 years and it's over again. I like Nakamama's long straight hair very much, um... Sadako.
