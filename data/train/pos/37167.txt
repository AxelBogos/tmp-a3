Twelve angry people show the jury system in the United States. they are all ordinary people, but it is these ordinary people who support the true democracy and legal system of American society. People will not remember where they came from or where they will go after this jury meeting. You can't even find their names, but it is the tens of thousands of nameless jurors who can best ensure that justice will not be trampled on and that goodness will not be trampled upon.
