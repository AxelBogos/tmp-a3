People who are accustomed to watching fast-paced movies do not recommend it to the movie. The four-star music pictures all like the rough plot, look at the stereotype, but respect the original work for the first time. I can't figure out who came back to admire the director for the second time. The deeper meaning of the story is that you can't calm down and feel it. What people don't understand is that there is another star that maliciously marks those who don't watch a movie.
