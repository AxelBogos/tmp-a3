It can be seen that the 97 edition of Zhou Xingyi already has a great leading position, and the overall film is more popular than that of the 1993 edition. In particular, I feel that it has become a connotative film in an instant, but there are also flaws. This is also the careless shooting method of Hong Kong films, and it is too difficult to leave the country.
