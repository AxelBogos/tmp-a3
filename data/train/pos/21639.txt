Except for the suicide of sister Wujiang in this story is a bit outrageous, the others are all good. But now I feel that the action in the action movie is no longer something to watch, in other words, it doesn't matter who plays it. It was very touching, especially at the end of a few scenes, one committed suicide, one Jackie Chan was shot, and then accompanied by Jackie Chan's singing.
