The Mask of the Red Dead is my favorite of the limited Allan Poe short stories I have ever read. This short story describes a utopian small society built by the children of a rich family in the troubled times of rampant disease. and this small society was finally invaded by the Red Dead, and the dignitaries and aristocrats inside eventually suffered the same terminal illness as the lower classes outside the small society. In my initial idea, the seven colors used in the interior rooms of this little castle built by the rich represent the seven deadly sins of mankind, namely, arrogance, jealousy, rage, laziness, greed, gluttony and lust. But after I read a deeper interpretation, I think that the arrangement of rooms from east to west represents sunrise and sunset, and seven colors represent different age stages of people, from childhood to youth to old age. this also explains why our protagonist chased the Red Dead from the first room to the last room before he was killed by the Red Dead. In the end, all the people in the utopian small society died. I think the author wants to show that there is no nobility, inferiority and class distinction in the natural reincarnation of birth, aging, sickness and death.
