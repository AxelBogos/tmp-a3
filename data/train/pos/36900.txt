As a loyal fan with relish to see, there are so many familiar songs, hacked a Mike Love, and Brian's father and doctor, really won my heart, but the role of the two brothers is too weak. Paul Dano's part feels more than Cusack's part, and the doctor's control and girlfriend's persuasion remind me of "Truman's world". Finally, "Pet Sounds" has always been a favorite album, thanks to the band.
