The rhythm always seeks a balance between horror and humor. (the first half) the omniscient perspective knows that water pollution is the culprit, and it is more likely to serve the endless cycle of the ending, which is not very helpful to the plot. The plague can be said to be without cause, and the motif of "no cause" is echoed by men who do not know where to infect, little girls who bite people and haunted dogs. Several overlapping applications are very essential, and the lens composition has made a little breakthrough in the creative program of horror films. For example, I like the elevation shot of that child very much. Let me think of "hut in the forest", all escape from the forest in the wilderness, although "hut in the forest" is strange and chaotic, there is actually only one protagonist in the confrontation, some mysterious organization (I can't remember). In this film, in addition to the biggest water pollution, there is also scattered and small resistance, such as about three or four resistance from the beginning of the store to the police shooting survivors, and this accumulation keeps the best parts at the end of the film one after another. Among them, the contradiction in the store is still a black humor, "the gun for black people", which makes a real mockery of those racists. To tell you the truth, it's a bit unfair to fail.
