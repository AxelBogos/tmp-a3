Also known as dizziness, just like the mottled color of the image, the case is complicated and confusing, making people feel dizzy. Eighty minutes later, the 128-minute film went into the routine of "play in the play". A dream is used as a dividing line, and the color is boldly used in the dream, reminiscent of the urn in Akira Kurosawa's Shadow Samurai. Godal's "Madman Pierrot" also has a color gradient in the horizontal lens. The narrative is accurate and overly natural. Hitchcock completely negates the 80-minute foreplay and starts all over again, and a huge plot gradually comes to the surface. Change the overall tone of the first half, which is slightly stable, and restate it sharply. The front is "illusory", and the second half is "true", and it is also true and illusory. The film shows a sense of blurred texture, shuttling back and forth between reality and dreams. James Stewart gives a vivid interpretation of the trance and falling state of mind of a retired detective. Fear of heights is a good point to lay the groundwork. At the end, the appearance of the nun frightened the shipbuilder's wife and fell from the tower. Ferguson, who had overcome his fear of heights, could not tell whether he was teased or hurt, and the tower clock was rung again, disturbing the dreamers.
