There were two scenes that moved me. One was that the lead singer persuaded Commander Gao in the name of jazz continuation that it should be what the director really thought. One was to cut the two scenes together like a revisit at the end of the film and complete the imagination. Try a variety of scheduling in dealing with the rhythm, and the amazing use of lights is so charming. This young man named Damien Shazelle is really terrible.
