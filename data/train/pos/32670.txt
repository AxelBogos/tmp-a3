The halo of the protagonist of this film is too outrageous, just these people riding horses in the hail of bullets, unexpectedly did not die, it is too exaggerated. But the real thing is that none of them are dead, and it is estimated that it is not easy for the writer to let one of them die. We can only complain that the director's performance is too unreliable.
