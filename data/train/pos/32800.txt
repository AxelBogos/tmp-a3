I actually saw crying at the end. The whole film was very funny, not the kind of joke that tickled you deliberately. I didn't expect that this was produced by Warner. I always thought it was produced by Pixar. As a result, Warner made a feature-length movie with Pixar's violent cloud and send-off crane many years ago. it's a pity, but Pixar's results are really good this year.
