This film, to be honest, is very good, but it has not been publicized properly. As the only costume drama in the summer of 2015, it gave me a lot of expectations and really lived up to my expectations for it. The word "new" is well reflected in the film, with a completely different plot and ending. In fact, what can not be seen in the theater version, this film also gave me a lot of reverie and tears. The laughter at the beginning, the tears at the end. It's worth watching.
