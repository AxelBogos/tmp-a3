I just saw Arthur 3 yesterday, which is obviously a child-style film. The villain's child becomes a good boy with the help of the good boy ~ but I still like the appearance of the villain in the mini kingdom, especially Princess selinia's brother didn't find it was a French film. The graceful degree of the picture is good.
