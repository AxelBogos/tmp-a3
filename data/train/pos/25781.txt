At first, the conversation between the two policemen was very topical, "but when Mr. Yamada was really lost, he was even more frightening." although it was violent, it was probably because it was too neat, and it didn't arouse any disgust to me. Instead, I paid more attention to the warmth under the violence. The ending will certainly think of "the tranquil sea of that summer". The scene, music and tune are all very similar. That "thank you" is really soft in my heart.
