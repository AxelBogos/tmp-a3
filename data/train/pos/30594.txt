Dragging the blessing of the Beijing Film Festival, I finally saw the sun shadow I wanted to see in China. I was so excited at the beginning! 11 Super man, cute and cute , there is no difference in height between ðŸ˜„ and Nai! It's so handsome for the village head to play the villain! Star Eye [retweet] sota and Kyu Tanaka are also the icing on the cake! When you see the long-haired Kuriyama Qianming, you still think of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS at that time! Cute and hot! I'm so happy!
