Now I really feel that good literature and art is full of literary and artistic youth who think carefully, and finally get out of control. This tone has now become a kind of fashion, and many small films play tricks in this respect, but do not see its interesting and exquisite. For example, in the process of observation, the thinking of people and social relations, the reflection of contemporary consumption concepts and other small private goods are very interesting and can be touched. The actors are also online, the male spirit, before and after the transformation is very obvious, he has also become an important foothold to distinguish the narrative time. If Nolan began to play narrative in the first film, I have to admire it. The light and shadow is very impressive, and the shooting is reliable. 20090219 said: Nolan's debut film ~ likes the black humor in it very much ~ although it is a big boring film, it is not boring at all ~ very interesting ~ (watching a movie with C for the first time)
