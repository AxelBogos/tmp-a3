When I think of an animated short film Tango, everything is chaotic but connected to each other, and only in such a modern comedy can we feel both a sense of presence and the utopian illusion of repeated sensory highs.
The composition of the set is first-class, and the perfect scene scheduling makes the plot smooth. Several photography angles are very similar to Hope's Night Ranger. I can't help thinking of the sense of alienation between people depicted in Hope's paintings. it is uneasy for people in modern space to be exposed to the camera. At the same time, even if the person is close at hand through a layer of glass, the light cast by the artificial light source of the indoor city is full of ghosts, which makes the outdoor observer seem to be in the dark, forming a great contrast.
