In a well-behaved biographical film, each actor successfully interprets his or her role. I had seen Jude Law's movie several times many years ago, and I thought it was a disadvantage to look too good, so that people couldn't focus on acting, but I thought he could just act as a vagabond, a dude, and be a vase. In the past two years, my hair is getting less and less, my face is not there, and I am still playing a prodigal son, but it makes me feel impressed. That's what other bigwigs do.
