The best Korean movie I have seen in recent years. Do not talk about politics, only from the plot description and character setting point of view, are very wonderful. North Korean dads are introverted in their love for their loved ones, perhaps because of their special status. South Korean dads are closer to modern times. After all, South Korea is also a developed country. However, after being developed, should we forget that our poor brothers embrace the thighs of selfish rich people for a moment of happiness, or should they turn around and hold their brothers' hands and jointly create a peaceful future? I vaguely feel that I can experience a lot of things I have seen for a long time in my life. No matter where the war takes place, no one will escape unharmed.
