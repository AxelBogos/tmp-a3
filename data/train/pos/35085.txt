Kate Winslet's wonderful performance was ignored because of the director's sex scandal?! The film is still in the style of "family melodrama" in Hollywood in the 1950s, photography is a living Douglas Seek style, and Kate's character is a typical Tennessee Tennessee Williams heroine, specifically referred to [streetcar desire] and [rose tattoo]. At the beginning of the film, see Douglas Seek's Spring Wind and Autumn Rain.
