OMG, you are a communist, a poet and a rascal. You can tell lies so beautifully, just like the shadow of waiting in line in Plato's cave. But no matter how stupid I am, I can't wait any longer to keep my trust in Comrade Tito and the Party. I'm going to kill the cruel fascist pig with my own hands. I come out and I see the sun. What a beautiful world!
