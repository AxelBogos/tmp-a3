5 stars only give feelings, BGM and ED, Ai Maeda and Hamasaki ED duet are really good. After reading the first four chapters, there is no expectation for the plot, Yuan Yong Kyung-taro continues to feed shit is also expected. This sequel can be called an animated classic, but I still hope to end it as soon as possible so as not to tarnish the name of digital.
