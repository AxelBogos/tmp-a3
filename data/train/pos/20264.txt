2018BJIFF# the popularity of old Beijing, from children to the elderly, is shown in this film one by one. Without love and friendship, I would rather go back to the pure days when I wore a red scarf. For most of the night scene, it seems that people at night will not have to be punished. This is no longer an era of loyalty. Walking on the edge of society, who understands such loneliness and pain. The footage at the end of the film pushed the mood of the film to its peak, as if only death could escape.
