The overbearing president falls in love with the crippled Cinderella. I admire three kinds of screenwriters most: being able to tell comedy stories to make you laugh to tears, suspense stories to make you nervous, and love stories to make you excited. The scene in the pool was so beautiful that several supporting actors were very bright, the clumsy and lovely secretary, the bosom brother of the big brother, and the heroine sister of the beautiful thing. The heroine's smile is really cured!
