I said why the film is so long. It turns out that there are a lot of documentary materials with black and white tones in the middle, which looks very interesting and makes the audience one step closer to the actors. Maggie Cheung's performance of such a legendary figure is so temperamental that it is really beautiful to put on a cheongsam. This star lineup is also a highlight, although the overall impact on the development of the story, the feeling is still very good!
