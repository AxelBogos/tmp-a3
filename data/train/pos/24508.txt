The heroine's husband is so handsome! Yes, the main plot of David and Claire is very complete, all get has arrived, and the song is also very good, but from the beginning to the end, does anyone care about him, who is just a straight man, can see that he loves the heroine and likes children (it is really true to sleep on the couch with a child who is not his own). ), fully accept the lady's best friend's family, and even the best friend's late husband is completely regarded as his own friend. The identity of men and women is also completely ok. This ending gives a thoughtful expression, this character is not so functional. Whose is the pregnancy of the last mistress of BTW?
