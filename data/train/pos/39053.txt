When Vuitton's belt lit up for the first time, it went unnoticed, but when it came on for the second time, the camera paused on his face for nearly half a minute, white teeth pounced on it, and the source of terror at Yukon Castle suddenly turned to the 'poor guy' who asked him for a salmon.
When Baiya was in the tribe, he looked at the moon alone; when he sold gloves with the tribal leader, he looked at the moon at the window; when Vuitton stood on the cliff to watch the sunset. He has yearning in his eyes. But he is never selfish and leaves warmth to everything around him.
Bold, overwhelmingly domineering, emotional and righteous, flesh and blood, the characters in the story seem to be manipulating, using and arranging the life of white teeth, but from a natural point of view, they are also the embellishment of white teeth.
There is no lack of people's temperature and cold in the animation, but the emotional leakage that is really unadulterated is the purest of white teeth!
