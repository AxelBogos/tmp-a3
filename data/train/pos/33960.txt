8.3 Bob Foss borrowed part of the documentary form to organize this Lenny Bruce biographical film to show the controversial acting career of the 1960s comedian and freedom of expression fighter. I think this film is to some extent a prelude to Foss's Jazz Spring and Autumn, which is full of autobiography, and I also believe that it is the inspiration of Woody Allen's Xili to some extent.
