The acting skills of the actors can only get a score of 7, but the fighting scene is absolutely 9, especially the duel between King Kumgang and Daisuke, which is really excellent and extreme! Inadequacies, every scene that should be moving is too weak to feel at all, and some of the plots are slightly grandiose. King Kumgang proved by his actions that people do not live to death, and that the only way to enter heaven is love. Daisuke was a real samurai, but he was defeated by faith. Such as Timoray, madness.
