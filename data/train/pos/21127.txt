Really deserve an encouraging score. Aaron Kwok's Putonghua is getting better and better. I think the jump in the Silver Empire at that time was a serious one. The story is very simple, the lines are very bad, the director is very ambitious, I shot in Tianjin is really beautiful! Just for the director's ambition, you can get a good score!
