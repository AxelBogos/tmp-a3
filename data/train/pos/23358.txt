It is quite difficult to change the original work into a film, and it is already very good. What is missing is the heart of the character behind the picture, but the Swede's psychological struggle is all the portrayal of his demise, so the film has lost part of its core soul. But the picture adds more details, making the text fuller than before, together, very invincible. In Merry's ultimate conversation with the Swedes, I had never felt so truly that life was meaningless.
