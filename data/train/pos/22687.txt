1. Our love and excitement about classical music should come from movies like Anna Karenina, not from the concert hall. 2. Now can you wash the white by changing the beautiful man in the opposite corner (although he is bald and beautiful)? Karenin's feelings are all in a pair of eyes, too affectionate, finally bending beauty to get rid of the heroine N streets of Wallensky. 3. The adaptation of masterpieces to learn from drama-like scene switching is very imaginative and interesting. Ps:AJ blue eyes and white thighs are beautiful!
