The story of Jane Austen has always attracted me, because the reason why she never married all her life always bothers me. With the growth of age and experience, understanding her choice is no longer as difficult as it was then. We can still meet her choice 200 years ago. To marry or not to marry, there should be no regrets in the choice made. The only way to get a man like Mr Darcy is to make him up. Reality is never perfect.
