The setting of the whole film is still very magnificent, although it is the last glory of the Tang Dynasty, it still shows the sense of majesty of the upper kingdom of China at that time. There are indeed gaps in character styling and lines, but after reading it, I feel that it is not as bad as 3.5 points.
