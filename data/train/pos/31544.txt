It was probably because of this film that I abandoned the person I loved at that time, even though she loved me, when watching a boring summer vacation in Shanghai in 2008. Still do not want to use secondhand because she has been forced by someone or something to make her remember and recall and most movies will go back to their first love at the end of the film.
