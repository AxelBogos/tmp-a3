If it is really 2012, even in the middle school campus, losers have such a strong dominance. I don't know when it will be T T if I want to see a film with a plot to shoot DICK directly. Bad comedy is the only type that can completely ignore Douban score. 4.5 Channing half star, I really don't think it's suitable.
