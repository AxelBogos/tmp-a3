"Huang Feihong" under the lens of Tsui Hark shows a vivid and three-dimensional image of a chivalrous man under the background of poor people's livelihood in the late Qing Dynasty, which lies not only in the inherent foundation of the film, but also in Tsui Hark's use of the contradiction between tradition and modernity. Through the shaping of various character details, the audience has found the epitome of the times in change on this character, making the image of the guru played by Jet Li really deep in human nature.
