Very beautiful lens, cute young people, clear eyes, pure love and careful temptation, little by little close, people envy, like a pair of childish hands, reach out, touch your heart. You can only sigh in your heart again and again that it is good to be young, but in your own youth, you have never experienced such love. Life is rough and scribbled, middle-aged days are even more insensitive, about to grow old, do you want to go on like this?
