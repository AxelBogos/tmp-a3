What a great language for the camera! The dream given to Dali is almost like an empty left waiting for heaven and earth, and Mukhran Road has a shadow. Although a dream corresponds to the reality seems to be somewhat idealized, but also slightly limited by the genre of the film. Even if I watch it today, I still throw some suspense films from the beginning to the end for dozens of blocks. PS: why is Bergman so big?
