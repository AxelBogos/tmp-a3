Uncle JD is very good. There are a few places where people laugh so much that they have a side stitch! XD narrative powerful scene description in place, the characters are lifelike. The charm of the paper moved to the wonderful humor on the screen. The Roman picture in the film is humorous and romantic! The photography color is beautiful, the rhythm language is cheerful. JD interprets the characters in a different way! It's one of the JD films that have surprised me in recent years. If the production goes on at this level, it can be continued. Forget the pirate series. =
