It's easy to make punk, but it's easy to make bad; it's not difficult to make a biographical movie, but it's easier to rot. However, this film is very good, although the erosion in the film is messy but conditioned, it makes sense. After Nancy died, the former punk Sid died, so the music became Disco,Sid and began to get in the car with the child who had been bullied, and Nancy in his eyes became a dignified lady.
