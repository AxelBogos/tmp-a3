I wish I thought that a novel with only nine knives was made into a movie, but he also directed the film. Then I can only say that nine knives are more appropriate to be writers. The original book looks good because it gives us a good medium to recall our youth and the past, so that people can quickly indulge and find themselves. But the film is really raw, so that people always have a feeling of drifting away.
