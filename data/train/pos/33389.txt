Dr yang is everywhere. Nicole's character helps jason, who killed her son, out of guilt as well as a process of self-redemption. There are no big ups and downs in the film, even the quarrel between husband and wife or nicole finally burst into tears in the car are handled very calmly. But it really moved me. My idea of the best feature film in the second half of the year
