The standard Taiwanese film is full of the feeling across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan accent, coastal wind, unique scenery, everything is so special, it is the taste of the other side of the strait. A very simple story of cycling around the island, but it gives a different feeling. For a moment I felt that the protagonist was like Forrest Gump, with a very simple idea and a very difficult persistence.
