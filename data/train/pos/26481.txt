Unexpectedly good. The two actors are very likeable, and the film shows the loveliness that belongs to the top students. Then it's nice to have some stalks as R Xi, and I remember laughing twice (both happened to be in the car). Unlike other sister quarrels commonly used by R Xi, I was brought in this time because the credibility of the two characters was very high. Although the situation of graduating from Chinese and American high schools may be completely different, that emotion still infected me. I think this director is no worse than Miss Byrd's director. It is also true that the ending still does not turn the crush into true love.
