The shooting is in order, it all depends on the story legend! I used to write a lot of anecdotes about J. Paul Getty in the thrifty rich series, so the film didn't surprise me. This family is particularly powerful. Although the company of Paul Getty, the richest man in the world, has disintegrated, it has left a huge Getty Art Center to the world. His son Gordon Getty made his name in art history as a composer, his grandson Mark Getty founded the famous Getty Images and served as the trustee of the British National gallery, and his granddaughter Ariadne Getty also directed works such as 127th hours that I have seen, but it is a pity that kidnapping ruined the life of my grandson Paul Jr. The great-grandchildren are not ordinary people. Andrew Getty invests and makes movies at the same time. Paul's son Balthazar Getty starred in masterpieces such as Lord of the flies, and formed Ringside to release four rock albums. Brother and sister Nats Getty and August Getty, who came out publicly, also made a splash in the fashion world.
