Obvious Beidou Shenquan cartoon adaptation version, the reactionary SM clothing setting is very powerful! Max lost his wife and son in the first episode and the dog died in the second episode. I'd like to see how the third episode went. Mel didn't have any acting skills in the first episode, but he obviously improved a lot in the second episode and began to act like a star.
