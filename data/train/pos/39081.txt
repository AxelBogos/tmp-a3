I saw an early movie at the Hong Kong Film Center. Although there are several scenes scared, but I have to say that the fantasy, scary, funny, warm knead very well, proportionate, rhythm match, the role interpretation is wonderful in place, the picture is exquisite. A good movie that can't be missed.
