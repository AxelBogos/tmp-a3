The picture is very beautiful, ink wind praise, after watching it, I want to sit and wait for the wallpaper table, it is as good as Xin Haicheng. The terraces, mountain streams and other scenery that the little prince and his master walked through were extremely beautiful. But the plot is a little too much, and the ending is too perfunctory. I wonder if it would be better to piece together the lost 20 minutes. In fact, some of the characters are also portrayed profoundly, and there are a lot of memories, but they do not play a role in the plot.
