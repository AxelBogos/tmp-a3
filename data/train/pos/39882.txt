When it was released in 1998, I went to the cinema far away with my classmates to see it. It should be the first movie I went to see. It is shocking that it was a large-scale production with an investment of 100 million US dollars that year. The spectacle of the movie was only seen again when it was released in Avatar a few years later. Cameron is a great director.
