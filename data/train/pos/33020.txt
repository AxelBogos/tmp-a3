The list of the best animations in my heart is about to be rearranged, and the lacrimal glands collapse more than once or twice. MiyazakiHayao can put an end to this. He is still him, striving for excellence, standing on the standpoint of truth, goodness and beauty rather than the country and the right, as a craftsman, living tenaciously and never giving up his paintbrush and morality in his heart. Thank you, pops!
