I watched it on TV many years ago, but I was deeply impressed until now. The reason for leaving an impression is not because there is anything special about the content or special effects, but because the fear atmosphere created by the director is in place. In addition, the idea that wearing yellow clothes can ensure safety and a fence can separate the danger is very novel, and monsters break through the boundaries and sneak into human houses, which makes people feel very promising. It is an alternative horror film with steady rhythm and excellent picture and music.
