Unexpectedly, the staying power of the film was so strong that it depressed the audience to death. Norton's acting is good, but compared with tough guys like Colin Farrell, Noah Emmerich and John Walter, his police uniform doesn't match his bookish style. I still like to watch him get a good score. So far, Norton's film is almost done.
