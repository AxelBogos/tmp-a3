First of all, serious: rich kinds of music, rich kinds of dance, laughing points and tears, it was really a wonderful performance, silently weeping several times in the middle, I don't know why it can especially get the suffering of artists.
Besides, it's not serious: it seems to be mistakenly involved in the male fan meeting (and it is estimated that it is probably a rotten girl cp fan ðŸ˜‚), there is a suppressed scream from the female audience at the bottom of the mouth, ðŸ˜‚, but the male second is really very get. I am also surrounded by fans ~ the lady held by him probably can't sleep tonight ~ and it's really a very high curtain call ~ the live performance really needs a warm response from the audience to be fun.
