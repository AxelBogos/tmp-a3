The score is not high, but I am happy to see it, and a little moved. When we are in love, we will feel that each other is very beautiful, when times change, but it turns out to be so terrible? At least not so Nice at all. The person you really want to meet, who does not meet many established standards, is the one who makes you the most comfortable. How many scum do you have to go through before you meet true love? I have no idea. In reality, female masters tend to regard every scum they meet as true love.
