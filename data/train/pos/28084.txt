Life is like a play, but no one can move forward steadily in the framework they set, and no one can finish every step they want to take. Want to copy the past Johnason is not in loneliness to find a hot back, careful selection, role-playing to take a road to reunite with the past. But that person is not the present time after all, no matter how many people play Brandon, they will leave eventually.
In fact, Johnason simply can't accept someone who is not Brandon to go to the Grand Canyon with him. Even if I indulge in it again, I still know very clearly that all this is an illusion and must return to reality. This kind of self-directed and self-acting is just stabbing a knife into the wound again and again, and he keeps remembering everything about Brandon, and then has to end it himself.
So I love the ending.
It makes sense not to cover up an old injury with a new relationship.
Johnason accepted Brandon's death, and Adam, who accompanied him all the way, came to the end of the journey. Maybe the well-fitting shoes in that photo were the best result, and he had his own journey.
