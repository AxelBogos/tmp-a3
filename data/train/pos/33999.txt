A story full of love and warmth, although it is not the ending I imagined. But it would be nice to start a new adventure. Xiangjia's yard reminds me of "Totoro". Master Miyazaki's summer is the real summer. There are young hunters who are not good at words, which is as simple and lovely as the one who borrowed the umbrella.
