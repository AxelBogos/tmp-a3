I think when this kind of actor is a director, Liu Yunlong is good enough, much better than some people. Domestic films still have to have a plot to support, dizzy and noisy is also better than no content, just spelling out the details to meet an untalented director is disgusting. It's just a little too slow. For those who are sentimental and slow in vain, they might as well be replaced with the real material of Fan Mei's lens. I don't know how long her peak will last. The ending is also good, Zhao orphan, people who have read books.
