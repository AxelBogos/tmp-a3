American mysterious director Terrence Malik returned to win the Golden Bear after 20 years of rest, still holding photography and natural light, the scene was selected outdoors and in the jungle, full of philosophical speculation, and most of the thin red-line films implied that they were sprayed with blood. Malik believed that human nature was good, and the difference between human nature and animal nature was also good, and he made a deep analysis of the original sin and the view of God. The experience of the Conservatory of Music makes the role of music outstanding.
