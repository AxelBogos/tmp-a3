I feel like I strayed into the set of Westworld. In a word, it is the manifesto of neo-liberal human optimists: no matter how technology develops, home, emotion, and human nature are still higher than and will eventually prevail over technologies that rely on data analysis. (the only ultimate goal of these technologies is to eliminate failed and backward individuals or races and to create a perfect utopia that is accurate and efficient. The ultimate enemy of human nature is still fascism in the cloak of technology rather than anything else. What if there is another enemy? Everything is still so black and white, is it easy to tell the outcome? What's more, this victory or defeat is also with the highest respect for human nature since the Renaissance, as if it can continue to be invincible in the unknown world of the future.
