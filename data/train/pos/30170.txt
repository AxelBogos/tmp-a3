After watching the movie, it was higher than my expectations. Huang Xiaoming played in harmony with a group of foreigners. There was no play at all, and his English was better than that of his Chinese partners. It's beautiful to play. Stallone has been unable to play since the death squad, but the image of the wise mentor is still very good. The scene of Hades is very high-tech. Standard American action movies, the plot is simple, but the editing is a little fragmented.
