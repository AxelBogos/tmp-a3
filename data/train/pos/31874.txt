DOX screen painting, followed by again, so much like this film that I don't get tired of watching it several times ~ Gothic style, gloomy tone, weird music and atmosphere are all good! (PS: the translation quality of various TV stations varies, and the CCTV version is OK, at least "Bad Bourne" has been used.)
