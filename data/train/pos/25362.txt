Without Sadie, who has a crush on Tess, without a single German mother who has always been at odds with pharmaceutical companies, without businessmen who have not been avenged by the government, without government officials who are terminally ill, without barefoot doctors who want to repent, without the principled UN pilot and Tess's cousin's lawyer, Quaye would never have been able to find out the truth and make it public.
