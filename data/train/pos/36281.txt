The classic is never tired of watching it. Over the years, you still remember the innocence of watching this movie. Although it is no longer as innocent as it used to be, when I heard the names of the movies mentioned by Zhou Xing at the beginning, they turned out to be dirty jokes. When I saw him say, "put your glans in", they were no longer the true glans of childhood. Although this innocence has gradually diminished, Zhou Xing and Wu Junru's Hong Kong movie stars of their generation have brought me a lot of memories.
