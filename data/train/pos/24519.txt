It's really bloody and heavy! But it's also profound! As a movie made 30 years ago, its disgusting and real scenes still shudder or even look straight in the eye, and the special effects and makeup are too powerful! The assumption that monsters can imitate humans also shows suspicion and ruthless killing between people. It's really a great horror movie! The open ending has an aftertaste. It is a pity that the structure is a little tardy and dull.
