There is actually no close connection between several stories, but the storytelling and editing are good, so it looks smooth. The topic is serious and heavy. It makes a lot of sense for Kyle to say who exploit who. Whether Ben will wake up in the end is a mystery. There are a lot of familiar faces, and the famous Mark Jacobs actually plays the pimp. I'm stupid!
