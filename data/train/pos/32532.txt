Very Hitchcock! For the first time, I was frightened by an old film from the fifties and sixties. I can't believe there are so many skills to use in it! The scenery is beautiful, Novak is even more beautiful! The scene of Novak throwing flowers on the beach of San Francisco is constantly run in my mind, it's really beautiful!
