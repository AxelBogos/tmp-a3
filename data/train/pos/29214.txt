When I read this book in high school, I felt that the three values were damaged and I was all working on it. I read it today a long time later, and we all gradually had feelings and sighs, and our ex was also the best person. Compared to the growth of all things drunken and restless, this film is more like a clear spring, the cruel series of youth is generally like this, there is no dazzling artistic conception of beauty, a simple seventeen-year-old in a small city.
