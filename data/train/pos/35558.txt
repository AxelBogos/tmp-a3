Tonight, I had the honor to watch the classmate director Zhang Pu's masterpiece "Grey Monkey". Director Zhang Pu came to the scene in person, and the audience was enthusiastic, enthusiastic and laughed constantly. The whole film of "Grey Monkey" uses multi-line narrative means (flashback, insertion), and many characters have distinct personalities. All the characters in the play are closely linked by a jar and a secret recipe, reflecting the impetuous, thought-provoking and thought-provoking nature of modern society. Generally speaking, a film that is very attentive should be highly recommended. Finally, I hope "Grey Monkey" is a box office hit. Come on, Zhang Pu! Come on, Grey Monkey! Mess with him!
