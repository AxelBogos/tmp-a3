At that time, Emperor Liu Yingdi was still acting cute, a simple and kind-hearted noodle stall owner; temperament beauty Wu Qianlian, a killer cold to the bone; and Han Jae-suk, an explosively handsome Korean who pursued thousands of miles of responsibility. Gorgeous combination, although the plot is ordinary, but the superb acting skills of the three actors are really eye-catching.
It's a little unpopular, but it's well worth seeing.
