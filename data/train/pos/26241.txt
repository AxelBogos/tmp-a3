This is the first American TV series I have seen and chased, that is to say, it will be 10 years. Since the third season didn't have a happy ending, do you think it's right for us to make a sequel? It's still like a specially extended version of the TV series. Logan, you're long broken. If you are more stable, you won't have any lines.
