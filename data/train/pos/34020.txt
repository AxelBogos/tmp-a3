I was moved by Molly again, although it was just an ordinary, low-cost TV movie, but it had a great soul and story behind it, and it was amazing hope that I could understand and implement Molly's idea in my life. I would like to be a rich man in spirit. I want to see Kingston's play again. The feeling of theater will be a little more meaningful.
