Use solid horror elements to pave the way for detective suspense dramas that test human nature. After watching this film, I think of the movie "eight villains" with a common element: background, "Snow covers the Mountain". Starring: Kurt Russell. Detective suspense: humanity in the Chamber of Secrets.
