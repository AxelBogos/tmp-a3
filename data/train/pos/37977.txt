Without the experience of losing parents, you will not feel the charm of the movie. Spring, summer, autumn and winter are used very well, reflecting the essential problems: supporting the elderly, the distribution of money, brothers and sisters in the house after death, reflecting the reality very much. Finally, you should listen to where the old boy's father and time have gone. We should love our parents and do more filial piety when our parents are alive. Anyway, we have a lot of feelings after reading them, and we despise those low-scoring parties. There is no aesthetic appreciation and no feelings at all.
