Watching a movie without knowing the background story at all. Although it is a sports theme, but the tone is very cold and objective. Especially the appearance of DuPont. It's very disturbing. It was such a tragedy in the end. The performance of the three leading actors is admirable. It's a pity that the whole plot is too insipid.
