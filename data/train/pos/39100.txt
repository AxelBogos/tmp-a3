Mature women see through everything, "love" is nothing more than this, men are nothing more than this, "love" must have something to ask for, there will be no lack of sex in the definition of love. But when she met an aimless boy who claimed to be "love" in a "peeping" way that was despised by others, she also took a lot of time to understand. I think Keith's movies want to tell us that movies are also a tool to constantly correct their inherent beliefs and to understand different people.
