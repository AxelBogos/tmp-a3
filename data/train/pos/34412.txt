I am a mentally handicapped fan of Zhang Yimou. I have to watch his movies no matter what. Many directors dare not set foot in this subject matter. "alive" was banned 20 years ago. There are too many scruples, which limit the performance of Zhang Yimou. I personally think that the themes of that era need "pain" to touch everyone's hearts.
