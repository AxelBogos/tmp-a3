Emptiness has an empty substance. Death, exile, fame, fall, emotion is just water on the back of a duck. Teenagers who are not yet in the second year of middle school refuse to grow up, predict and define, every strange legend is full of unknown vanity and excitement, and the irony of not squeezing a teardrop is the biggest praise for zombies. Playfulness is projected into the gamification of vision and rhythm, magnifying the interesting rhythm. In several brainwashing songs, the presumptuous one is too old to be numb and painful. The revelry on the big screen was both mournful and fascinating. The first half is better than the second half. @ Library
