Sister Nagazawa used to be so beautiful. I haven't finished watching the TV version yet. I've finished watching the movie version first. Moriyama was really out of taste at first, but the more I saw it, the more I liked it. Wonderful charm. Clothes and bags are in love! It's a good story, too. Look! I like the design at the end of the film too much!
