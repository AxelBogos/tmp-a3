On the whole, "the arrival of the son" is the only one that is better than "the depths of the Soul" in the visual effect of the characters, which is cold and cold. The former can not get out of the common pattern of Japanese hot-blooded action animation, and the creation of the two films is obviously based on a completely different cultural environment. The CG of "spirit", the structure of the world, and the active and original role must be a feast for hard science fiction lovers. The concept of ultimate truth is not original. After all, it is a milestone to give five stars.
