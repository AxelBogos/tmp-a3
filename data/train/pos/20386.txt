Although I like the first Spider-Man most emotionally, I have to admit that this film is most in line with Spider-Man. The bottom of the campus, rooted in the community, civilian heroes. Some anti-capitalist content is also added to the film. The new spokesman of Spider-Man is good, he still has temperament besides poverty, and he is quite a man in the car with Lizzie's father / of course, my favorite is Iron Man! Captain America turned into Zhu Shimao / the villain wrote well! / need to choose cinema carefully
