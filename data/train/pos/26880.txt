The gloomy atmosphere is good, and Black Stalin is black and thorough, but the deficiency is that the plot is not arranged enough, all kinds of conflicts are carried out hastily, the character characteristics of the characters are too obvious and not obvious, and what is the main conflict node is not clear enough. in addition, Russian-style English is really a little bit that. Of course, there are a lot of black history that we don't understand. I'll start with Baidu.
