Looking at it again many years later, I still feel sad in my heart. When Danzhu (serenity), who was captured by British soldiers, was insulted and watched her father lead the Tibetans to attack but died in the gunfire, she sadly sang the Tibetan song to her own nation. sing to Gesang (Shao Bing), a man she loves but does not love her. I have already burst into tears.
