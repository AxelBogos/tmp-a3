I remember when I was a child, I had to walk a few blocks to go to the bookstore to rent a robot cat. At that time, I always felt that the robot cat and Nobita were as real as they were when they were reunited in the movies. Although I knew it was very bloody, I still cried like an idiot. It was great to meet Doraemon when I was a child.
