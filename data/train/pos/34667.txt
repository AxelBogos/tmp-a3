Seeing that Douban's score is quite low, everyone may have something to complain about, but I admit that all three protagonists like it very much. I am surprised that this police story is quite different from the previous plot in the end. maybe the plot itself is not worth playing 5 stars, but as a family film plus Jackie Chan's great performance and very sensational song, I like it very much.
