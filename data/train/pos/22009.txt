I was impressed by the original soundtrack of the movie in the 1980s style. It's okay for the male lead Kristen not to speak. He looks like a standard handsome guy, and his mouth is ruined. The heroine played by Wino is really twisted. Since she doesn't like small groups to do evil, why should she step in in the first place, but Wino acted very well.
