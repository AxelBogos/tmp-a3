The story of the 1960s is closer to the essence of the times, and its spirit and structure are open. The deficiency is that the soundtrack is too full, there are too many close-ups of characters, and some scenes are handled too poetically and slightly uncomfortable. There are too few films brimming with a sense of nobility and should be given extra points.
