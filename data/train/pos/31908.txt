It is suggested that Little Spider and Iron Man produce a bubble sitcom "Old Pedagogue and Primary School students", or Doctor Strange and Iron Man produce a variety show "mouth Arena", both of which I would like to watch for another few decades.
Accidentally found that Dongbing and Rockets put together is also very cute.
