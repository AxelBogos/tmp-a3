(the theme of this film is not gay at all, and it is too hasty to classify Douban into gay films.) many films on Douban have been underestimated. Had it not been for Nie Yinniang this year, the film would have won a greater honor in the Golden Horse Awards. It's hard to describe what it feels like to watch this movie. 106 minutes are spent as if they were three hours, as if they were snooping into the erosive life of this group of people, not surprised at what happened, just watching coldly.
