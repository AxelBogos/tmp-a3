The vengeance of forbearance finally becomes more aboveboard! I haven't seen the count of Monte Cristo, but I should be able to learn a thing or two from this film. The first part introduces the inhumane abuse, and although the moviegoers know the layout for a long time, the court still feels that kind of trick and revenge step by step in a question and answer. I have a strong sense of age. At that time, Peter and Bacon were really handsome. A good man, a BT, heh.
