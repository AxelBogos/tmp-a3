The plot is very brain-burning, but full of emotion. More than 20 years later, Hao is not out of date. A recent law graduate could not resist the temptation of a high salary and came to a law firm that secretly helped Chicago to launder money. Any lawyer who wants to leave the firm will die, and FBI has launched a secret investigation into the firm. Mickey doesn't want to be in cahoots, so he could be murdered by a law firm. To cooperate with FBI monitoring, to be an insider and a tainted witness, you will lose your lawyer's license. Both sides threatened him with his jailed brother. My girlfriend opposes living a hypocritical and seemingly perfect life because of a certain sense of justice. Where Mickey will go and how he will get out of trouble. How he will win his life back. The feelings are very rich and sincere, and the lines are very classic and completely unconventional. It's perfect. Tang's face is at its peak. He is the work of God.
