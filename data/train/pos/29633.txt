The rhythm is as quiet as a mountain stream, and the smooth flow has been decided. I saw the fat-bellied Castle for the first time, and once again saw Jacques Merlin's ceremonial wig before his death and the suffering-like drops of blood dripping from his hair after dozens of bullets. Jacques Merlin seems to have been filmed by the director as a hero like Guevara. The speech speed is too fast and the pronunciation is vague. I can't hear anything. Sigh.
