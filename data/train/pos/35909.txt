This film is also very good, and even tastes like Houmai, but what remains unchanged is Woody Allen's talkative skill, using the misplaced character relationship to continue to explore the balance between the spiritual world and real life, and finally go back to the starting point. so that the meaning of life is empty again. Woody Allen's fear of death is very similar to mine, so it seems to resonate with me. Diane West is great, and Michael Kane's role as a scumbag man is also a surprise.
