The showdown between the two beauties was very enjoyable. At the end of the love scene, I began to sympathize with Bill, like an earth-shaking revenge, but a misunderstanding. He calmly waited for her to arrive and had many opportunities to kill her, but he just wanted to know why she had left. Women are far more cruel than men.
