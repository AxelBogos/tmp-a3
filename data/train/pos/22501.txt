The setting of Spanish amorous feelings is a masterstroke, and the unique taste of the cat comes out at once. I really think it is prettier than Kung Fu Panda, and the laughing point is more advanced. From the parody of specific films to the parody of genre films. The plot is compact, the theme is classic, but it is not a mean person who stops to realize his dream. Good!
