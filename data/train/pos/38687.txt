It turns out that what I like is a horror movie about emotions. the mother of this film, the kind of sensitive and fragile pain, is actually the loneliness of childhood, whether it is the mother or the child and the dead child, as well as the sister-mother-daughter relationship in the Red Lotus of the Rose. "Midnight Bell" is boring by comparison. These two Japanese horror films, in addition to scary passages and music, are still very normal and slow feeling of Japanese movies.
