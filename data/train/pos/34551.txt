I am very grateful, this movie at least proved that I still have the strength to move. A little bit of life taught me to measure and compromise. I thought that when I grew up, I had lost the sincerity and softness of my original dream. Unexpectedly, I was still willing to be moved by Rudy's stubborn persistence. As long as you stick to the identified dream, the whole world will help you. I burst into tears when I thought that I had never really insisted on anything and would always be the first to give up myself.
