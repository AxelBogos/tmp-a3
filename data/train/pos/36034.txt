Super beautiful! Taking into account all the laughter and tears, pictures, music, plot are all super great! I burst into tears three times. The screenwriter is so clever! Cartoons are most recommended this year! You must see it! If you don't look, you will regret it! I'm thinking about watching it a second time! I almost forgot to recommend the black-and-white short film paper man at the beginning. Super romantic, the whole process let me cover my heart of a short film ~ also super recommended!
