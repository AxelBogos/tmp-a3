I watched it once and a half. The sci-fi part is a little bit, but the black of the mirror is so fascinating that it can't be touched; the road chat-up and thriller parts are handled very well-most of us have been playing certain roles. I don't really want to be myself until I meet another person. By, extraterrestrials + freaks.
