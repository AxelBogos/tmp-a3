I was fooled by the trailer. The war scene is so great that it is seldom seen in recent years. With Mao Zi's character, it is acceptable that he is not delicate enough in the emotional drama. The little boy has had all kinds of monsters and robots from the child's point of view, although it has gone a little too far, but it is not bad. The winner of the heroine's life, got her son back, saw her boyfriend's true face and found a new boyfriend by the way, on the importance of a fake phone with a long standby time.
