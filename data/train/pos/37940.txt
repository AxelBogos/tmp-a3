Although for well-known reasons, many expressions are extremely restrained and imply spring and autumn writing style, the whole film, whether it is the theme or the expression of details, is a great breakthrough in the current cinema films. The paradoxical transformation between the old and the new, the individual fate in the collectivism atmosphere, and the tragedy and stirring in the flames of war are all enough to make people ponder over and over again. None of the best movies I have seen this year.
