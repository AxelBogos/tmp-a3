Every minute. No procrastination, no preaching. 126 minutes doesn't feel very long at all. The right benefits at the end of the plot. That's great. The complexity of human nature, mixed nature, the calm of the elderly. Gold joke. DOBBS's fate foreshadowed many places at the beginning: begging, dreaming of eating and drinking, and embarrassing the wrong waiter, CURTIN's only human hesitation to rescue the mine when it collapsed. Later, it was mostly for justice.
