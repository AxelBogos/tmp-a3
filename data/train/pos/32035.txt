I think it is a very successful adaptation. It's just that in my impression, it's a pity to lose the first story. I remember that when I read the book, there was only the first story and the last reply. The change from the past to the present here will be a bit abrupt, for those who have not read the book, I am afraid it will be a little difficult to understand, but I think the editor has tried his best to tell the story clearly.
