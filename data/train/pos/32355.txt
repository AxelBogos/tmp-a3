This piece of ten stars! The ending song is the love me song that I have failed many times in Amway! I told you not to john newman, hum, my wife is a mother-in-law! The ending matches this song so beautifully that I can't help singing! By the way, give some blessings to the college entrance examination dogs full of people, and show some restraint after the exam.
