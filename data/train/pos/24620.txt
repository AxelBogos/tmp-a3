Strangle your fate in your own hands. Disney played well this time, the values chicken soup is sweet but not greasy, and the personality setting of new and old characters and the promotion of the storyline are exquisite and accurate. Excellent voice lineup, strong dubbing. But there are still some touching places missing.
