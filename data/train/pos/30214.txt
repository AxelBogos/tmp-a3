The most classic horror film in film history has long occupied the first place in the selection list of horror films, adapted from real events. Director William Fred King successfully created a terrifying effect, especially the scene in which the girl was possessed by evil spirits, which became a classic and imitated by future generations. The film won two Oscars for best sound effects and adapted screenplay, as well as four Golden Globes. Later, there were two sequels and prequels, which were not as wonderful as the original.
