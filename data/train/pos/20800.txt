Well, recently I have seen several Spanish movies, "the Invisible Guest", plus this one, they are all suspense themes. although they are not particularly novel, they are much better than domestic suspense films. The biggest suspense is to dig human nature to the extreme. Besides, the heroine has a great figure!
