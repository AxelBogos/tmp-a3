This movie really feels good. Douban saw a lot of people giving bad reviews. I just want to ask if you who give bad comments have ever seen a movie, have you ever been amused by the plot in it, and only those who have seen it are qualified to comment. If you haven't seen it, don't talk about it there. It's hypocritical. If you have the ability to watch it, you will comment later. Don't just target people there.
