I watched the TV version a long time ago, so I specially searched this period of history. I watched the same film during the National Day this year. I chose this one to watch with my parents. Of course, the overall level was good, shocking, positive energy, and the beginning of the picture was a little shaky. I looked a little dizzy, and then I felt a little bad at the end, and the final scene was not shocking enough. The two chased ships did not introduce the results. In view of the scarcity of excellent films in the past two years, a star has been added.
