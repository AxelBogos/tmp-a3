Looking at the panic in my heart, the child is the most naive, but the child is also the most frightening. Malice is always given directly. Unexpectedly, there is a law on the protection of minors, and most of the laws protect the wicked. There is no place to lend a helping hand, and there is no law to do anything about domestic violence and abuse. I'm so angry.
