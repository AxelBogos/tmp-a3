As a result, the film went on a "dew-level" trip to the United Kingdom, covering all the beautiful scenery, the Middle School in Iraq and the Old Castle in Luisha, while Luo Lu always failed to play cards according to the rules of the brand, was stiff to the Beverly Rivers, and did not know how to pretend to be adults and interesting to Colin. Of course, at the end of the film, Colin could not help being separated from the show, but there was no sense of sadness, which was, as Colin said, a beautiful response.
