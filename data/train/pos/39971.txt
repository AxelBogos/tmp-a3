I love it so much! All actors are unique in this day and age. Every step of Ang Lee's film is worth my taste over and over again, and this work which poured into Jane Austen's love and hatred has become my second place after Brokeback Mountain! The two girls, whether they triumphed over emotion with reason or emotion over reason, all got a beautiful engagement! Maybe what you lack is willing to be insipid! Professor Snape!
