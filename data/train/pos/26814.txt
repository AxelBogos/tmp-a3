The extramarital affair of the midlife crisis and the "feeling miserable" life brought good memories to another young woman. What does this have to do with Michael? 90 minutes of two days can not save boredom, but boredom brings aberration. Disorder is a personal emotion. In some places (bar chat, one-night stand), the rhythm is not well handled, but the shortcomings do not outweigh the shortcomings, and the innovative way of expression attracts me all the time.
