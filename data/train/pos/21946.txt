Quite UFO temperament, Chen Xiaochun's opening monologue Su lost his teeth, and then the whole audience was coquettish and extremely cute. Wu Zhenyu's sunglasses in white left a sound of tears. Lin Zixiang is quite rich in one or two shots of his father coming out. Du Yange, the veteran dubbing veteran of TVB, plays a gay of Shenzhen. There is actually a lot of contrast between Shenzhen and Hong Kong and the plot of two old women playing the other woman, but it is not the focus of this film. In the end, it is a comforting reunion.
