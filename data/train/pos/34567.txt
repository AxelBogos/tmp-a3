I was almost moved when my mother said "I'm on your side" to her, and I reversed it the next second. I don't think this film is used to wash white. after all, outsiders don't know the truth, but Tonya itself is a tragedy, and this film only explains it from her own point of view. Margot Robbie is not a vase at last, and his acting skills have improved greatly.
