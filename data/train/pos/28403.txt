About survival, about civilization, about home. This is a little girl calling the beast in her heart to find her own world in this cruel world with courage. Photography and soundtrack are excellent, the little girl's determined face is really impressive, and the surreal scene at the end with warm-blooded music gives people a sense of rebirth.
