In Red Flag Street and shirt Ma, Aojiao Girl, three single men and women watched together, hehe. I like it. It is very good that there is no suspense or bad end. The footage of the frog brother being crushed to death gives the picture of the body. Very good. When Gao Yuanyuan said on the top of the building that she would go down to see her grandmother and mother, my first reaction was that she wanted to jump down and kill herself, and then saw her dead grandmother and mother.
