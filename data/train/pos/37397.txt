Turning to a comment, I thought it was well written. After reading the 2019 edition of Nezhu, I thought the old version was even more valuable. Maybe it was because I was old. "there is an irreducible contradiction in the core part of Nezha: eviscerate and gouge out the flesh, bring the red lotus back to life, give it all back to you, and do not involve you-this is not a relationship that can be reunited, this is not a comprehensive story with room for reunion. Behind the word "Nezhu" is a deep-seated hatred, a primitive and naive free individual who betrays the injustice and injustice inflicted on him and gives irreparable self-killing. "
