I don't understand. There are always some people on the Internet who say that this is Western style and make it look like they know everything. I don't believe there is nothing foreign in your family. Shut up if you don't want to see it. It's for entertainment. At least the movie also learns the western style of art design. Compared with Pleasant Goat, don't you think "Magic Brush Ma Liang" is very high-end? What a film of conscience! Support domestic movies!
