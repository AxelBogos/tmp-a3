I read it in a high school textbook (extracurricular book), and I was impressed. Some people evaluate it as classic, others evaluate it as garbage. This can not only be explained by personal aesthetic point of view, I think personal self-cultivation, taste, realm of life also have a lot to do with. This movie is rated as rubbish, what is that classic (soap opera? ). It is more appropriate for a bean friend to evaluate "abnormal normality"!
