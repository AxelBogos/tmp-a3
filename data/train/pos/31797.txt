The Russian version of Sleepy Valley. Faint cult style, the same damp, cold, the same story environment, similar character settings, similar tones. Clothes are my favorite, packing out the various tones of the characters; the props are exquisite with a sense of czarist pride; Lao Mao's BGM is great; the reality and magic performance are so close, and the sense of suspense is also great. The most important thing is: the woman is very beautiful, the figure and skin are really TMD.
