In the name of making the piano, this film reveals the memory of the production era of large factories in northern China all the time. Rusty factories, street ballrooms, barber shops, Russian folk songs and dances, like the simple and humble lives and ideals of ordinary people in the film, fell to the ground with the sound of explosion. washed away by the torrent of the times. I was deeply impressed by Qin Hailu's performance. The film would be better without those abrupt black screens.
