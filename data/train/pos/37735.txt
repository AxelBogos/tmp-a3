I can't remember the other things I saw when I was a child. I still remember the classic scenes in this film, such as brain sucking, being captured by flying insects, sniping and killing my own people, the Zerg siege base, spitting fire, the classic bomb, and so on. This film gives me a dream of being a soldier and a pilot.
