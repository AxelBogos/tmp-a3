I went to Tsai Tsai, but I didn't expect to see Wu Zun, saying that I knew the egg hurt as soon as I saw him (fans, don't shoot me, it's a fact, his Sword Butterfly really made my eggs break for many years). In fact, the whole actors are very good, the script is a little hard at the end, but the characterization is really good.
