I remember finding it because of the gadfly. When I was watching a Russian film in my dormitory in London, I was deeply fascinated by the blue eyes of the man. Gadfly is my favorite novel, but the plot of the movie is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the forty-first has taken an exploratory step, and most importantly. Russian actors are born with the elegant temperament of classical beauty, which is beyond the reach of today's European and American actors.
