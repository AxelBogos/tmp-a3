I wonder if the director has read a lot of early Japanese comics (anyway, there are a lot of Beizhai). When I see a screw on my head, I think of Yichun. I have too many metaphors to think about. I have to see it scene by scene. Clay animation is rarely done now, and it is still done so finely, and visual observation is the best animation in the past five years.
