The polyphonic sonata of wisdom, the history of immortal struggle for power. The narrative structure is clear and three-dimensional, and the details are miraculously related. Jealousy is the driving force of evil, desire is the root of sin, civilization is the boundary of limitation, pursuit is the right of self, love is the resistance of goodwill, and morality is the hypocrisy of evil. The malice and darkness of Feng's works, the commanding height of imagination, the masterpiece!
