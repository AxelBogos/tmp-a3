The textbook says that please learn to use the transition of "door" through this film; it turns out that the elements of the hat are actually more important to the whole film. Douban's synopsis is very silly. The actors of Tom, like Yu Wenle in my heart, should be very cool, but in fact they are very corny and not suitable for pretending. To borrow the slang that often appears in films, I am really tired of this kind of "high hat" movies: the director has a strong sense of existence and always acts. / "What heart?"
