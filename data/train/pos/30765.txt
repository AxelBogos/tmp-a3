On the first day of launch, the original party came back from the movie (IMAX 3D)! I have a high degree of loyalty to the original work, and I have done an excellent visual presentation of the novel (Hermes is so beautiful). Whether you have read the original work or not, friends and neighbors, go to the cinema to see the Martians cute when you are free! (write a comparison article later to introduce the general differences, and then put a summary of the original works sorted out in the past few days.)
