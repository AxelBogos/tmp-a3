The portrayal of the heroine's perspective is much clearer, but she still doesn't understand why she has to be filmed in two parts. This is a very common story.
As for different angles, men and women think differently, this â€¦... You can't let me watch a movie with a microscope, and I can't tell why.
Women's pain for the loss of a child is explicit, while men are introverted and reserved, but both are so painful that they cannot lead a normal life, but it is clear that the impact on women is greater. In "him" I feel that the man's distress comes entirely from marriage, while the unjustified, neurotic woman described in "her" who strives to break through and indulges in the old days is really real. The hostess hates why her husband can downplay the loss of a child, and can not get out of the strange circle, while men are unable to communicate and relieve this state of mind, so the marriage exists in name only.
But in the end, she went back, silently walked behind him and said hey, I think, she still can not let go.
