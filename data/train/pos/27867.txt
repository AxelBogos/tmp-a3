It took three nights to watch the film for nearly three hours. I don't know, I don't like the ending very much. This ambiguous ending is not necessarily a kind of regret, but will feel a little disgusted. Will the heroine and the cafe youth let nature take its course in the future? She should know very well that the person in front of her is another soul even though his appearance has not changed. What she likes is the man who fascinates her in the cafe. Or the one who later made her crazy infatuated with passion. If she loves the latter, how can she accept others easily? Compared to the love in it, it was Bill who moved me. Whether as a man, father, or even chairman, every aspect is admirable.
