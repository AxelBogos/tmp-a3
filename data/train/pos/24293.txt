03:05 . When I was a child, watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only watching fighting and killing could not interpret the desires and ferocious feelings of the people. So after so many years, I looked through it again in order to find the answer under the question of a friend. Personally, I think Li Mubai's words before his death are the sublimation of the film. Presumably this film is also to let go of the desire for love and the plunder of life, only put down is the real possession of it.
