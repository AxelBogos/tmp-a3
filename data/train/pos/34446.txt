After seeing each other, Dong Su and I stayed at home all day, thinking about the true meaning of friends. I didn't know the true meaning of a friend until the teacher wrote it on the blackboard, which was a "long-term close companion". Dad said that people want to live justly, but now I am very confused. I can't tell what is righteousness and injustice.
