A very classic thriller suspense film, until the end, many question marks went unanswered. The attack of birds on humans in the film is slowly approaching. The best part of the bird attack really shocked people with a creepy sense of fear. Hitchcock tells us that we can shoot ★★★★☆ horror movies on sunny days without scary special effects.
