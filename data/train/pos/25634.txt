"Drug War" completes the censorship of police and gangster films to break the ice, "the scorching Sun" further broadens the scale of police and gangster films, and "Mekong" is the beginning of police and gangster films that have really become the big head of Chinese-style films. I am optimistic to find a way out in sissy's growing blockbuster market (if dubbing is not used, Peng Yuyan's dialogue progress is really too great, get rid of black).
