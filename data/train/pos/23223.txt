I don't think it's a masterpiece symbolizing the awakening of female consciousness, although Monica shoots openly in front of the camera, which does have the effect of questioning the audience. On the contrary, I feel that Bergman made a film that many people have a "pretentious" understanding of love, because it is full of reverie and utopian "I hope summer will always be like this." In the process of watching, I kept away from watching, until I was finally felt the same way by light and shadow, because this is the yearning of every life that I can't escape.
