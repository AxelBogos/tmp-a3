A very stylized, complete and mature thriller, people are out of breath. The overall speaking speed has been unexpectedly slowed down, and even Spanish and German have been switched from time to time. The frame of the stop animation changes at a low speed, and the picture is filled with a sense of graininess, and the character is generated, melted and decomposed with latex-bonded white paper, plastic film and tape, while the characters are successively displayed with plane illustrations and three-dimensional paper puppets and puppets to the plastic mold. Many close-ups of amputated limbs, especially hands, in which the spread of hand flowers and branches and vines are really shocking, while the scene of pig deformation is the most terrifying part of the film. The room is equipped with a combination of virtual and real materials, sometimes dyed with pigments, sometimes an orderly combination of exquisite miniature models, and sometimes litter accumulation of dead leaves and dilapidated goods. Images of repressed long shots, darkness invading and candles burning and rising create an atmosphere of suffocation and despair. The sound effect is perfect, the dubbing itself weakens the vibrato, the use of reduplication, raving, etc., plus the sound effects of tapes, plucked stringed instruments, hymns, running water and even magnificent symphonies connected from beginning to end. Finally, let's go back to the implied political metaphor and want to kneel.
