I wanted to see the movie many years ago, but I didn't have good resources. Today, I finally finished watching HD. The acting skills of the three actors can stand up to magnification, and there is enough suspense about the setting of changing the will by implanting a chip in the soldier's brain, and the plot in which the protagonist peels the cocoon layer by layer to reveal the truth. The overall score of four is a good suspense drama.
