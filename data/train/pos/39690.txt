In a typical author's film, the details are cited everywhere, and the private goods are full. "the softening of Otilla's knees" corresponds to Trevor's work "softening the skin". Otilla feeds raw meat to tigers, which coincides with Chabrol's film Tigers like to eat raw meat. My movie is like a third-rate novel. The final ending is happy.
