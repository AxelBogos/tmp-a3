I have only seen this film twice, once I saw it more than a decade ago, and then I couldn't bear to see it again. I didn't go to MOMA until last week. The film is no longer just about love, but also about the redemption of human nature, about how to extricate oneself from history after the wall falls. There is a lot of humor, but more sadness. There are two details I like very much. One is Gorbachev's thinking, and the other is the passage of time and space in the Nazi decadent painting exhibition.
