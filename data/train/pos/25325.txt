In my impression, sports movies are mostly biographies, but if they only talk about one game, what if both opponents use pen and ink? The game is wonderful, but if the opponents on the field are all your acquaintances, you know, know their mental journey, then this game is very chewy. Of course, in-depth depiction of the inner world is very successful, but partial literature and art, tennis is only two people after all, the part is also Borg, has not yet jumped out of the sports film routine.
