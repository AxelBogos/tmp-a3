For the sake of populism, the man did his best to help the prisoners enjoy normal treatment. Unexpectedly, some people tried to escape, wasting the kindness of the man. That old Gao is really rubbish, full of benevolence, righteousness and morality, secretly talking about running away. Clearly saying that prostitutes are indecent and shameless, but they are still in love and eating the drumsticks of prostitutes. What he said when he died was really pretentious. The director's portrayal of human nature is excellent. A rare good movie.
