Watch motivation: how unity is formed. Audio-visual fun: the first scene is edited into three stages, the first is dangerous, the second is shooting at each other, but before the meat, the third is the meat. Denzel Washington's character is typed, cynical and then for a reason, cold on the outside and hot on the inside.
