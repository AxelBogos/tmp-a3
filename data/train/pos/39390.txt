I have always thought that Ang Lee is one of the few Chinese film directors who really make films for the sake of art. I am ashamed to say that although I have always said that I like Ang Lee very much, this is indeed the first film I have seen. I am very grateful that the director can give up the huge box office interests in the mainland while insisting on the expression of the sex scene. There is really no better way to express the gradual change of feelings between Mr. Yi and Wang Jiazhi. In addition, I like Tony Leung more.
