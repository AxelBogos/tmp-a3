2013-12-05 is really a divine script, although it involves the philosophical issue of self-consciousness, but the plot in the dialogue is completely a happy scene, especially when Malkovich himself gets into it, I am crazy about what will happen, and then I laugh crazy. There is humor and irony in the absurdity, which makes people look very happy. Of course, there are still some details I don't understand. And didn't recognize Cameron Diaz... at all)
