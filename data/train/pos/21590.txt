Very interesting films, multiple possible story structures are rare in Hong Kong films. The plot, which was supposed to attract me, was a little confused because I was distracted that day. Hey, it's absolutely impossible to concentrate on watching the film. C's explanation is very good. It's an honor to be named and speak. Haha! Such a film should really be recommended by a "professional" guy!
