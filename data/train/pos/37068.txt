To quote a sentence I saw: "the real heartbreaking experience is when you return to your hometown with a feeling of homesickness, but when you feel out of place, it is not your hometown that has changed, but you yourself have changed." Believe this sentence, it hurts a lot of new immigrants and young people who have moved to big cities.
