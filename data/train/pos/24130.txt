Ah Jin originally intended to pay attention to the current situation of immigrants in Germany, but the choice of stories and perspectives gave people a strange feeling-the director reflected on the past from a German point of view and expressed his concern about repeating the mistakes of history. however, the mood conveyed by the film seems to sway between cosying up to the Germans and condemning ethnic xenophobia. And the ending of the death together makes the film look more like a type of story served by the private law of violence.
