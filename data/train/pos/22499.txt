The ridiculous 3D effect ruined the film. The whole film has no 3D effect at all, and people have to wear glasses. As a result, the picture is gray, lifeless and even unbearable. The advantage is to follow the previous narrative style, and let the theme of love throughout, touching. The unforgettable performance of the actors also saved the film. Overall quality: three and a half stars.
