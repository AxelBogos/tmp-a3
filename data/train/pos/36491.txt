Romantic, sweet, sad and helpless fairy tales. The presentation of love is specific and delicate: attraction, lust (opera stands, faces flowing on the dance floor), giving, inferiority, pain. Less editing; the transformation of time and space with ruins as clues. The camera expresses psychological closeness far and near. There are always people in the environment who even rob the host (ballroom section). There are many brisk comedy treatments. Marcelo's dance, shaky confessions and snowy canals are wonderful and beautiful.
