Commentators all say that the second film is not as good as the first one. I haven't seen the original version and I can't comment on it, but the cliff movie is better. Uncle Kagawa's acting is very good! It should be the face control that feels bad. Although the appearance of Uncle Nishijima can not be said, but his acting skill is not even a little behind Uncle Kagawa.
