The husband's heart is not as chic as his appearance, and his abnormal vanity due to the environment makes him want to embarrass his students to show that he is strong. On the other hand, students also have strong self-esteem, but they are suppressed and gradually on the verge of outbreak. The wife was very thorough and told the story of their relationship. There is essentially no difference between a husband and a student. The part of fierce conflict is very wonderful, and I like the composition and color very much.
