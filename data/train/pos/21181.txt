Cartoons can get rid of the restrictions of the camera, and a few push shots of this animation are exhilarating, like that shot across the vast prairie, the shot pushing through the spire of the bridge to the animal team, the confident atmosphere that injects vitality into the whole work. I advocate that movies should have domineering and moving shots. Now national films need more because of such shots. Can carry incomparably powerful artistic and cultural forces.
