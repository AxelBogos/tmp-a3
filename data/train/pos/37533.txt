The first film I saw in Germany was of great commemorative significance. although most of the dialogue was not understood, it was still one of the excellent horror films in recent years. The use of the camera is really fastidious, coupled with Carpenter's divine soundtrack. I don't know what those people who play one star or two stars are picky about.
