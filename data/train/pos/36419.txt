Very good Indian film, plot, action, comedy, song and dance everything! Although the film is three hours long, it doesn't feel dull. There's a lot of feel. I feel that Indian films are very conscientious. The ticket price of a film seems to have seen two films, at least it will not be split into two films. Worthy of recommendation!
