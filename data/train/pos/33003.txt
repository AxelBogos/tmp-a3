Those who say that this movie is a bad film of the century and get a low score are all black fans, aren't they? Former teammate fans? Teammate fans? Don't say that my fan filter is thick, I can evaluate it objectively: although the editing of this film is a little chaotic and the plot lacks convergence, it is not so bad that it can't be seen on the whole, and Zhang Yixing is definitely a bright spot. His strength on the big screen is handsome, handsome to suffocate, just here is worth the ticket price, and the baby is very cute!
