I went to see a movie because I liked the original work. Generally speaking, it is quite good. Apart from using mobile phone monitoring, I really do not understand why this paragraph should be added. It is really embarrassing that two women, two men and a woman confront each other. I really can't understand the pinhole camera in the telescope and some monitoring in the phone. But fortunately, the second half has been remedied, and the end is also a little moved. That's good.
