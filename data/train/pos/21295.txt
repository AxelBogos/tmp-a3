It's a very simple storyline about how the weak meet the weak and how they stand out, but that's the trick of making such a predictable plot interesting and compelling. Directors, plays, photographers and actors are all first-rate. The movie has been connected since the beginning. Everything is expressed in a subtle way. Nothing is excessive. There are many tear-jerking scenes in this film. There has never been a boring moment. Every character is wonderful.
