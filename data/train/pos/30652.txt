I watched the movie over and over again in junior and high school. Because I like the lovely hostess. A scene that likes comedy but is tender. The hostess is beautiful, lively and female, smart and angry, and dresses up very comfortably, little adults. The baseball player is also so handsome, Shang Min's brother is also warm, the spirit and growth of the little girl runs through it, it's really interesting, and it's not too annoying to see it all.
