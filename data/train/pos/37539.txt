The discussion of selfishness and selflessness is the life of everyone. In fact, if it hadn't been for Yao Chen's inner monologue about women, I might only have given it to four stars. Although the main line is to find children, but did not fall into the strange circle of praising maternal love, reflection is very strong. Some of the details are adapted closer to Chinese society, which is rare. The two hostesses are also great. I highly recommend it.
