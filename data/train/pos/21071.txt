[7.7] unexpectedly, it was the best-looking movie I saw in the cinema in October. I don't like the old version of'78 very much. The old version feels that except for the excellent atmosphere, the other parts are a bit silly. This new edition not only inherits the excellent atmosphere of the old version, but also completely abandons the foolishness of the old version. Photography is good, there is a dazzling skills in the middle of the lens is very excellent. The whole process was tense, and the end was a little weak, but it looked good on the whole.
