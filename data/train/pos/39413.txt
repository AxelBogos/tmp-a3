Yes, a lot of people say it's not crazy enough. It was only after watching 4 that I came back to watch this first film, but I had a different feeling. Unlike the eschatological background of 4, this first film seems to be closer to reality, and the plot is more immersive. 4 is a movie worth enjoying with spirits, while 1 is a trance wandering during the outbreak of road rage.
