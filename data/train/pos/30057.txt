Three hours of life is full of pain, despair, deception, desire and love; the end of a magic frog rain (disgusting, don't dream about it), let everything end in some coincidence, love and tolerance can resolve everything. A warm ending. In addition: the long shot of PTA in this film is very fascinating.
