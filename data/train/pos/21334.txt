Why do Japanese "stray troupes" often appear on the screen? Mu Xin hit the nail on the head: Japan, like duckweed, has no roots and no bottom. Ozu can naturally see through, as evidenced by the Story of floating Grass. The Tent Theater in this village is another kind of proof: the pastoral song of wild life. Kawabata's "Izu Dance Girl" is a beautiful and simple prose poem with memories of youth. Talk about the beginning of the feelings of young boys and girls, primitive and natural posture. So that libretto is its best.
