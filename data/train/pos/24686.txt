Fluent finish Cloclo life, no urine point. Its own music is excellent, as well as the soundtrack of the music genius Desplat (BGM's theme melody is epic, recommended). Sure enough, the weirdo has become a legend of his genius, and Clo is a representative of the musical madman of obsessive-compulsive perfectionism. The whole film carries out the father's profound influence on Clo's life! There is still a lifetime of weeding out the old and bringing forth the new, and constantly learning other musical styles is the main point of its legendary success. I always thought he was going to die of overwork, but as a result.
