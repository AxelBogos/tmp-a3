When the twins played and sang songs depicting themselves at the beginning of the show, I knew I would love the movie. I couldn't calm myself long after seeing the ending painter get into my sister Diffin's car. Perhaps love a person can become very simple, from the moment the eyes meet, it seems as if I have seen it for a lifetime. Things outside their identity are very small, regardless of fame and wealth, or appearance, too many things are pale, there are so many things we should care about in the world, but in front of love, they all turn into dust, as if we could blow them away with the slightest blow. Some people meet, some miss, some meet again, we are always searching for life, eager to pursue the man of our dreams, and the answer is actually very simple.
