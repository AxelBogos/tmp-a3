Players who retired due to injury were able to guess the outcome of the game and were recruited by a gambling consulting company. At the beginning, everyone is really happy, the boss is good at talking, good at sales, good at the use of troops, victory after victory, but it is a pity that there are no victorious generals in this industry. Gradually, both of them fell into the mentality of gamblers, that is, they would never stop without losing, and it was their subconscious desire to gamble. The performance was wonderful, with an unexpected and conciliatory ending. ★★★☆
