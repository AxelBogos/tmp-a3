After watching the super-good-looking latest Japanese horror movie, I sighed that I had not seen a real horror movie for a long time. The whole film is smooth and clear, and it is a completely new film about Zhenzi. The picture is handled softly and cautiously, and the beautiful and fresh performance of Rimi Ishihara is also relaxed, which is really a gluttonous feast on the perfect vision. When can China be introduced? let us appreciate the real 3D effect of fear shadow, which has been destroyed by all kinds of domestic 3D.
