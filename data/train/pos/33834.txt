Hardy's work is the guarantee of a fresh, beautiful and approachable film, the film rhythm is very good, there is not too much dialogue, everything is expressed in the protagonist's eyes, movements and music. The story is a little thin so that some pure movie-watching people can be forgiven for misunderstanding.
