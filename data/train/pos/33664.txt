To be calm and objective, this is definitely a good movie. However, as a fan, I can't accept that the character I've loved for so many years ended up like this. It is indeed tragic and stirring, but I personally feel more about a miserable and hopeless future. I cried with my mouth covered all the time, and my heart was dripping blood in the last scene. No one knows how I played this five-star. I hate the government.
