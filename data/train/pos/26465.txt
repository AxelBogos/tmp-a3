What is the mission of the movie? The task of the film is to make dreams. There are inevitably all kinds of regrets in life, some people try to make up for them, and some people go with it. Some lovers know each other because of fate. They say "OK" to themselves before meeting, and say "happy" after meeting. I have to say that this is also a philosophy of life, similar to "gain my luck, lose my life", looking down on the wind, frost, snow, rain and clouds, smiling at the joys and sorrows and the lack of a full moon.
