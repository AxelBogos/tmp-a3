First of all, give full marks to photography and the color of the picture. Then complain about why you find Tang Lao Shi as the protagonist but only show your handsome face for 10 seconds? This film is Nolan's work to seal the gods, and the shooting technique of the air and naval battle, like this war, is free from attention and compassion for any character, but transcendently shrinks and crushes all people, ships, dignity, and hopes. There is no such war so beautiful, cruel and hopeful. The future is nothing but despair.
