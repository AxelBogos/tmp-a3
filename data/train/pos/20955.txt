I saw this film in a book introducing science fiction film three years ago, and I suddenly recalled it after watching Fuji 4 a while ago. I feel fine after making up classes. I don't know if this setting was new 18 years ago, but it looks ordinary now. The action play is just the right one.
High praise and short reviews are all 12.13 years, but somehow the scores are very low. Are there a lot of good movies in those years?
