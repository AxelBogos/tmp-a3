My affection for Chieslowski begins with Bai and ends with twins. I always think his film style is more than that, and the narrative is too dull. In fact, the same is true of the short film. In the first hour, even the description of violence was so cold. But in the last twenty minutes, Yazek told his stories one by one, as well as the real scene of the death penalty, which made people feel pity.
