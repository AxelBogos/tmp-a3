Although it's a Wolf biography, I've been thinking about what kind of man Perkins is, like Douglas and Wilde, or having a more silent and giving friend next to frivolous Jude characters. Catchers and geniuses each have their own scenery and loneliness. In addition to the pursuit of false fame, the heart of sharing the warmth of the world and sticking to words is more lasting, leaving behind for a long time and suddenly looking back and finally burst into tears.
