River plays a slightly neurotic and talented musician in it. Temperament is very different from the early days, the bones are more and more dissolute and emaciated, often frown, sink a lot of feeling. The style of the playing and singing part is like a rock star, he is really an immortal, this theme is appropriate and familiar with it, he loves to play music. Apart from chasing dreams, the movie is closer to love story, and love makes no sense except torturing each other.
