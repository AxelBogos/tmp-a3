What is most surprising is the extension of the Joker extension: he is no longer a person, but a group of people; he is no longer a single villain, but a symbol that can be misappropriated and copied. The followers of the clown are not afraid and succumb to his ruthlessness, but wholeheartedly follow the attitude and spirit he represents. As a result, the role of Joker is deconstructed into a larger context: when we talk about "the Joker", we are not talking about the miserable life of Arthur, but about the underlying narrative that is out of order and crazy when the old power structure is dispelled.
