The art of nature is the best art! The whole film is almost accompanied by the music. Poor and enterprising youth, help his small animals, strict and kind command. Accompany each other, stick to your dreams, and feel the music in your life. The plot warms the heart. The wonderful joining of the small animals has achieved all this! My heart was moved by the hero's persistence and calm! PS: I can't believe I'm so late to watch such a niche animated movie, but I feel very satisfied!
