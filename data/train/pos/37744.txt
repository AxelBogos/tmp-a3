It is simply a contemporary biblical fable, a sculptural holy face, a face of holy heart piety, whether it looks like God. He crossed classes, passed through the ages, and passed through all sentient beings, watching calmly and gently, even if fate had never treated him fairly, and would not complain about this bleak world. Italian film has its special magic at any time, and this female director is very talented.
