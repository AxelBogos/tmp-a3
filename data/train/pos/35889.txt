After watching the movie, I haven't read the original novel. I can't compare it with the original novel, and I'm not affected by it. Yesterday, I just saw "Iron Warrior" in Aiqi, so compare him with "Yunnan Chong Gu". If "Iron Warrior" can get 7.7 points in a certain eye, I think "Yunnan Chong Gu" should be above 8.5. Based on this, it can be concluded that, to some extent, the scoring function of an eye and a valve has become a tool for malicious competition and suppressing the opponent's box office.
Although Yunnan insect Valley cannot be compared with the first-class special effects of Hollywood films, it is definitely the best domestic film with special effects so far. Of course, the shortcomings of "insect Valley" are also natural and obvious: 1. The cause and effect can not be fully explained, which makes the plot a little abrupt. Some of the newcomers' supporting roles are a little stiff, and the actors and actresses have good acting skills. Some of the classic scenes of the trailers did not appear in the live broadcast and should have been cut.
To borrow a sentence in the film, "the beauty of the Heavenly Palace cannot be seen by mortals". Those who follow others are mortals.
