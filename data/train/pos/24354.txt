8/10.

The film observes the profound changes brought to the palace by the initial storm of the French Revolution in July 1789 from the point of view of a queen of Versailles.
The maid's deep and implicit affection for the queen determines her series of actions, her devotion and sacrifice. The film also gives a detailed description of the panic of the maids and aristocrats in the palace before the end, and the dragon is very professional!
