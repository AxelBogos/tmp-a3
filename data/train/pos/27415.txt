Tony is the only son of an overseas Chinese millionaire. Tony likes the white girl and goes to talk to him, and the two hook up.
Jane knew that some girls were out in prostitution in boarding school, and she wanted to find a rich man to try it, so she took the initiative to talk to Tony. After landing, the two went to Saigon, ate Chinese food at a restaurant together, and Tony drove her back to school. Just after school the next day, the black car was waiting at the school gate.
