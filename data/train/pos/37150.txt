Armored car unfinished building Paul vs. Tony Jia, undead bald head hot fight all over the world, the car as a plane to drive, Kurt Russell laser mirror! The scene of the war in Los Angeles ended well, but the whole drama story was obviously scraped up because of Paul's death. The parking building duel is a tribute to Wen Ziren's previous shot of "Death Sentence", right?
